And now international Europop star Ben\u00e9\u2019s eclair is weird.\n\nFull Description\n\n\tHiding in an undisclosed Los Angeles apartment is international Europop star Ben\u00e9 (writer/director/producer/composer/editor/sound designer Bennett Jones). He\u2019s dealing with a host of problems: his girlfriend was recently killed by a suicide bomber, a fatwa has been issued against him, and his delicious looking eclair is, sadly, \"weird.\" With only his manager Beefy to keep him company, Ben\u00e9 develops security strategies and disguises, writes songs and plays with his neighbor's cat as he waits for the inevitable onslaught of would-be assassins.\n\n\tSeven years and hundreds of dollars in the making, I AM A KNIFE WITH LEGS is an underground cinema wonder. Utilizing random scribbled animation, multiple Adobe After-Effects freeware plugins and, most importantly, comedic timing of proportions rivaling Ben\u00e9\u2019s songwriting abilities, it lacks anything resembling a dull moment; a rare occurrence when a film is this intentionally batshit weird. Bennett Jones\u2019 fatwa against all preconceived notions of traditional narrative and filmmaking is truly impossible to describe (did I mention it\u2019s a musical?) and is a refreshing reminder that creativity is the most important ingredient in entertainment.",
