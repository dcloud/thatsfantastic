    "description": "In the five years that have passed since the events of Takeshi Kitano's OUTRAGE, the Sanno crime family has grown into a huge organization, expanding its power into politics and legitimate big business. Exasperated at the Sanno's rapidly increasing eminence, the police force prepares for a full-scale crackdown on this huge yakuza syndicate. The Sanno's upper ranks are now dominated by young executives, and the old-guard members are filled with resentment while being pushed to the sidelines. This vulnerable spot in the Sanno hierachy is exactly what anti-gang detective Kataoka has been looking for.",
