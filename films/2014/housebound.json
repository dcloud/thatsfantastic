    "description": "Kylie Bucknell's attempted robbery goes hilariously wrong, leading to her being put under house arrest and forced to return back to her old family home, under the not-particularly watchful eye of her eccentric mother. But unlike her teen years, when she could simply walk out on mom's nattering, Kylie's ankle bracelet ensures she stays in close range of mom at all times, lest she serve out her sentence in prison. But as tedious as her mother's belief in the supernatural may be, Kylie must face an even worse reality: Her mother may actually be right and that their house (which she can't legally leave), may actually be haunted.\n\nRemember the name of Gerard Johnstone, because I guarantee you're going to be hearing a lot more from this talented Kiwi in the future. Blending wry comedy, richly drawn characters and legitimate scares, Johnstone's HOUSEBOUND is one of the most impressive debut films in years. Johnstone has a rare gift for switching gears on a dime and he puts it to great use, running the audience through a gamut of emotions\u2014pinballing from laughter to fright\u2014in this hugely entertaining crowd-pleaser.\n\nRegular Fantastic Fest attendees will know that the festival normally will not play any films that have previously played in Texas, and definitely not ones which have played in Austin. So why is HOUSEBOUND here after premiering at SXSW? Because it's fucking fantastic and we'd be idiots not to show it. That's why. (Todd Brown)",
