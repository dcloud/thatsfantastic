    "description": "Kousuke (famed Kabuki actor Ebizô Ichikawa) is the lead character in a stage version of the classic ghost story YOTSUYA KAIDAN. His girlfriend Miyuki (Ko Shibasaki) stars besides him. As the play unfolds, Miyuki and Kousuke's real lives begin to resemble the events taking place on stage.\n\nOVER YOUR DEAD BODY finds Takashi Miike exploring a realm which he rarely ventures into any more: pure horror. YOTSUYA KAIDAN is a classic story that has been adapted numerous times for the stage and screen. Miike puts his own unique spin on the tale by fusing theatre and cinema into an integrated whole. The narrative seamlessly shifts between the world of the stage play—scenes from YOTSUYA KAIDAN are performed on a meticulously designed rotating stage—and the lives of the characters. The themes explored in the play—infidelity, jealousy and violence—bleed over into everyday life. As with many Miike films, violence and surreality enter into the narrative in very pronounced ways.\n\nOVER YOUR DEAD BODY recalls an earlier period in Miike's career when films like AUDITION and GOZU changed the way in which audiences think about horror movies. However, OVER YOUR DEAD BODY isn't just a great horror movie: it is simply a great movie. (Rodney Perkins)",
