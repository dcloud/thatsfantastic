    "description": "Dan returns home to his apartment, nestled inside a dazzling art-nouveau building, to find his wife missing and the door locked from the inside. Even more peculiar, his elderly neighbor invites him over and recounts the story of her husband being taken by someone in the walls after he climbed through a tiny hole in their ceiling. Is it possible that Dan's wife has been taken too? Why is there a woman standing naked on the roof? And what's with the knife-wielding maniac?",
