    "description": "Early sixteenth century Korea is under the rule of King Yeonsan, a psychotic despot who is delusional, violent and completely cruel. He's served by two retainers, a father/son duo who carefully manipulate the king and control both the court and the country. Using the king's madness to torment, they abuse and even kill their personal enemies with reckless abandon. Into this triangle of intrigue comes a lower class woman who has her own agenda in getting close to the mad ruler. There can only be one winner in this desperate battle between parties who all have their own hidden motives. Whoever wins, the end result will not be pretty.",

    "synopsis": "Considered the worst tyrant in the long and rather oppressive history of Korea, King Yeonsan enslaved a thousand women to serve his carnal desires. This bawdy, unexpurgated (and almost surely exaggerated) tale of his sexual exploits is the heir apparent to the notorious 1980s era Hong Kong CAT III classics.",
