In Austin live-streaming a Q&A after a screening of Jill\u2019s latest film (taking place in Fantastic\u2019s Fest home at the Alamo Drafthouse South Lamar), he\u2019s the winner of a contest that will afford him the opportunity to have dinner with the object of his obsession. His hopes are dashed when a stranger named Chord calls to inform him that Jill has had to cancel. But then, in a strange and convincing display of his powers, Chord turns Nick\u2019s computer into the ultimate Jill Goddard spy machine, hacking cameras at the theater and even her cellphone, and allowing Nick an all-access pass into the star\u2019s life. Before long, it becomes apparent that Nick is trapped in some sort of sick game and Jill may be in danger.\n\n\tTaking place entirely on Nick\u2019s computer screen\u2014the action jumping from window to window on the desktop\u2014OPEN WINDOWS embodies everything we love about director Nacho Vigalondo\u2019s wild imagination. From his award-winning shorts to TIMECRIMES to EXTRATERRESTRIAL and beyond, Nacho consistently displays a knack for inventive plot devices that transform the mundane into the extraordinary, throwing his stories\u2019 characters into the most thrilling of circumstances. To that effect, OPEN WINDOWS is his most ambitious project yet.\n\n\tYou\u2019ll hear names like Hitchcock and DePalma thrown around in discussions about OPEN WINDOWS. Make no mistake; while such influences may be evident, what you\u2019re left with after they\u2019re processed through the wit and insanity of the man\u2019s brain makes OPEN WINDOWS pure Vigalondo.
