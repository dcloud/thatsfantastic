    "description": "The best films screened at festivals are the ones that sneak up on you. Consider 2014 Fantastic Fest entry FORCE MAJEURE, which seemed like a fairly innocuous film on paper, but ended up being one of the most talked-about movies of the fest. Writer/director Maren Ade's third feature feels like it could occupy a similar space. It's not because TONI ERDMANN is equally as funny in dealing with family issues (which it is), or that it's just smart enough to transcend where similar narratives have gone before (though it's that too). It's because that while Fantastic Fest is a \"genre\" film festival, the programmers are given a wide definition of what they can bring to the FF audience. So while FORCE MAJEURE and now TONI ERDMANN aren't what we normally think of as \"genre\" films, the programmers must still share them because they're just simply too good not to. It's the rarest of films: an almost three hour German comedy (??!?!?!) that never feels long. It's a funny, touching, original, KLOWN-level-insane-at-times farce for adults that left its Cannes audiences both laughing and applauding during the film, and left most of the critics there wondering how the hell this didn't win the Palme D'Or. You won't find TONI ERDMANN on the Fantastic Fest Fiend's Facebook page as a guess on what might be playing, but it will be dominating all conversation after it screens.\n\nOne more thing: This movie has perhaps the most uncomfortable and sensational karaoke song in the history of Fantastic Festâ€¦ at least on screen.
