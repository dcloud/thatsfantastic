    "raw_body": "Brief Summary\n\n\tAn impossibly personal portrait of unique filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn over the course of the shooting/release of his 2013 film ONLY GOD FORGIVES.\n\nFull Description\n\n\tNicolas Winding Refn burst onto the film scene in the late 1990s with the delightfully nasty PUSHER trilogy, and has continued to produce some of the most thought-provoking and visually spectacular genre-benders of any modern auteur. From Tom Hardy's career-defining titular Bronson to Mads Mikkelsen's feral One Eye to Ryan Gosling's icy cold Driver, Refn has time and again crafted nuanced portraits of deeply conflicted but undeniably charismatic antiheroes.\n\n\tIn MY LIFE DIRECTED BY NICOLAS WINDING REFN, Refn's own deep conflict is swinging in the breeze as we witness him wrestle with the particularly challenging production of ONLY GOD FORGIVES. Directed and shot by his wife Liv Corfixen over the duration of the production and subsequent Cannes debut, MY LIFE DIRECTED BY NICOLAS WINDING REFN captures the very private and intimate moments to which a traditional documentary crew simply wouldn't have access. The result is a fascinating, detailed look at a creative genius at work and also a portrait of a director torn between the general public's desire for a \"DRIVE 2\" and his own mission to explore more challenging narrative territory. Acclaimed composer and regular Refn collaborator Cliff Martinez composed the doc's original score. Director Liv Corfixen and her subject/husband will be on hand following the screening for a spirited Q&A. (Tim League)"
