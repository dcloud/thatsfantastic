    "description": "1975. Two miles west of London, Dr. Robert Laing moves into his new apartment seeking soulless anonymity, only to find that the building's residents have no intention of leaving him alone.\n\nResigned to the complex social dynamics unfolding around him, Laing bites the bullet and becomes neighborly. As he struggles to establish his position, Laing's good manners and sanity disintegrate along with the building.\n\nThe lights go out and the lifts fail but the party goes on.\n\nPeople are the problem. Booze is the currency. Sex is the panacea.",
