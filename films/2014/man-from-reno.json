    "raw_body": "Brief Summary\n\n\tA Japanese crime novelist in San Francisco tries to unravel a real life murder mystery in this acclaimed neo-noir featuring Takashi Miike regular Kazuki Kitamura.\n\nFull Description\n\n\tAki is a stranger in a strange land, a Japanese crime novelist visiting San Francisco when she finds herself drawn into a real life murder mystery. Knowing virtually nobody and adrift in an unfamiliar culture and city with only an aging sheriff to help, can her literary skills help her unravel the truth?\n\n\n\tHaving built a loyal following with a string of cross-cultural comedies, American indie director Dave Boyle (White On Rice, Surrogate Valentine) maintains his interest in all things Japanese in his fifth feature while also making a hard turn away from comedy and into noir. And the mystery format serves his fascination with the space where cultures meet and mingle very well indeed.\n\n\tGifted with a very strong cast including Ayako Fujitani (Gamera, Tokyo), veteran character actor Pepe Serna (with nearly 150 credits to his name you\u2019ll surely know the face if not the name), and Takashi Miike veteran Kazuki Kitamura (possessor of the finest eyebrows in all of Japan) Boyle weaves a clever and engaging world, proving that his skills go well beyond the comedy arena where he made his name. A deft exercise in crime noir, The Man From Reno was the very deserving winner of the LA Film Festival\u2019s Best Narrative Feature prize and we\u2019re proud to present it to Fantastic Fest audiences.(Todd Brown)"
