    "description": "A small Argentinian town is plagued by a series of brutal murders. One of the victims is a cattle industry scion named Julia Cotonese (played by Mercedes Oviedo). An ambitious journalist named Jazmin (Luz Cipriot) is looking for an opportunity to advance her career. While investigating Julia's murder, she finds that all of the murders share something in common: the victims are all tied to the local beef industry. Numerous suspects arise, including a radical environmental group that's been papering the town with pamphlets. As Jazmin's investigation deepens and she gets closer to a solution, she inevitably enters the killer's path.\n\nIn 2013, STILL LIFE deservedly won the main prize in the work-in-progress section of Ventana Sur's genre film market, Blood Window. Now, Fantastic Fest presents the film in its completed bloody form. Set against the backdrop of Argentina's tradition of cattle ranching and beef production, STILL LIFE is a slasher film with a strong dose of social commentary. Here, first-time feature director Gabriel Grieco gives the audience a serial killer whose motive is to avenge all animals that have been mistreated by humans. Although STILL LIFE carries a message, it is first and foremost a horror movieâ€”a very blunt and direct horror movie. Like a hammer to the head, STILL LIFE hits hard.
