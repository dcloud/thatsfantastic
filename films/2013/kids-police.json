    "description": "In the annals of crime, there have been few organizations quite so evil, quite so pernicious as the dastardly Red Venus. Always plotting on a grand scale, always performing acts of evil and violence to build their own power, Red Venus operates in the shadows - seemingly able to strike anywhere without notice before disappearing with only their signature business card left behind as a demeaning taunt to law and order."
