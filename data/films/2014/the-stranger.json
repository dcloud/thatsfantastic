In 2012, Fantastic Fest showcased the US premiere of Roth collaborator Nicol\u00e1s L\u00f3pez earthquake thriller AFTERSHOCK, and this year will feature Guillermo Amoedo's English language debut THE STRANGER. L\u00f3pez and Amoedo worked with Roth on 2013 FF favorite THE GREEN INFERNO as well as his upcoming KNOCK KNOCK."
