    "description": "Producer Conor Barry LIVE in attendance!\n\nIan Harding has never been one for the living. Never having found any real connection to society, Ian retreated years ago, scarcely leaving his room, with his only direct human contact being the mother who cared for him. But when his mother dies, Ian has no choice. He must find his way in the world.\n\nWhat Ian finds is that he cares for humanity no more now than he did years ago when he first withdrew. But the deadâ€¦ there are possibilities there. The dead are a blank slate poised to receive his hopes and dreams and feelings. And so Ian sets out to find himself through whatever means are necessary, online suicide support groups providing Ian with ample options.\n\nIrish director Brendan Muldowney's second feature, LOVE ETERNAL is a remarkable work that treads on controversial and challenging ground. Adapted from the novel by Kei Oishi, it's a poignant study of isolation, loneliness and longing that engages necrophilia as its central image without ever lapsing into exploitation or shock for shock's sake. Robert de Hoog and Pollyanna McIntosh deliver wonderfully nuanced performances while Muldowney establishes himself as a fiercely talented new voice. (Todd Brown)",
