    "description": "Director Ti West and Actor A.J. Bowen LIVE in attendance!\n\n\nTHE SACRAMENT follows NY photographer Patrick, who teams up with two Vice reporters to track his sister to a commune where she's finally free of drugs. Sober living is great in theory, but not when guarded by machine gun-armed men, or when the community's members seemingly don't have the option to leave.\n\n\nThirty five years having passed since more than 900 people took their own lives In Guyana, but Jonestown remains entrenched in our national psyche. One wonders what it would be like, with the 24 hour news cycle and our dependence on tabloid journalism, if such a horrific event would happen now. At the very least, it's fertile ground for a strong first person thriller, and that's exactly what West's latest is. With THE SACRAMENT, West strips away all context and focuses on letting the story unfold with several regulars in key roles: AJ Bowen, Joe Swanberg, Amy Seimetz, and Kate Lyn Sheil. As with all West films, the acting is standout, especially Gene Jones as the charismatic leader who's known only as \"Father.\" Jones is riveting as he simultaneously embraces and manipulates. Like the audience, Father knows where this story is going, but it's a story you can never take your eyes off of and you'll barely breathe as the dread slowly closes around you.",
