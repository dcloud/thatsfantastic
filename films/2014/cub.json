After everyone has arrived and things settle down, troop leaders Chris and Peter warn the kids that an intruder\u2014a feral boy named Kai\u2014has been seen lurking around the campsite. The story of Kai is just a tactic to frighten the kids and add some mystery to the outing. Upon arrival at the camp site\u2014which is plagued by some obnoxious locals\u2014Sam sees and hears things that make him believe that Kai is real. No one believes Sam, but the brutal reality behind myth of Kai soon becomes apparent to all of the disbelieving cubs.\n\n\tBelgian director Jonas Govaerts is mainly known for his short films and television work. With his feature-length debut CUB, Govaerts establishes himself as one of the most promising talents in genre cinema. He and co-writer Roel Mondelaers merge two seemingly incompatible concepts\u2014boy scout adventure and extreme horror\u2014to create a film that enthusiastically embraces genre conventions while expanding them into interesting new directions.\n\n\tThe key to CUB\u2019s success is an engaging and logical script, which boasts fleshed out characters, a strong narrative arc, an element of black humor and some rather clever visual and auditory genre references. All of these elements add up to what is unquestionably one of the best horror movies of 2014. (Rodney Perkins)",
