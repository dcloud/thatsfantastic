As one might gather, NORWAY is no ordinary vampire film. In fact, it turns vampire mythology inside out to create something genuinely weird. Zano is a burned out disco dancer prone to drug and alcohol binges. He maintains a code of ethics; he only kills people when he has to. In the case of NORWAY, the manner in which the story is told is as important as the story itself.\u00a0 Director Yiannis Vesleme\u2019s background in short films and music videos is reflected in the film\u2019s distinct visual style. Athens is depicted as a psychedelic alien dream world full of vivid colors, dark spaces and blown out landscapes. NORWAY is a spectacular trip unlike anything you\u2019ve seen before.
