    "description": "Directors Steffen Haars and Flip van der Kuil as well as actors Huub Smit and Wesley van Gaalen will be LIVE in attendance! \n\n\nOur favorite mullet-heads from Masskantje—Gerrie, Richard, Rikkert, Robbie and Barry—are in the midst of a huge rivalry with a bunch of dudes from the neighboring village of Schinjdel. There is more than honor at stake: Rikkert is fighting for both his beloved car and the heart of his enemy's pregnant girlfriend. While the New Kids are warring with the Schinjndel schlubs, something strange is happening in the nearby farmlands of Friesland that might threaten the security of the entire country. Will the New Kids rise to the occasion?\n\n\nNEW KIDS TURBO debuted in the Netherlands with the biggest box office opening in the country's history. Instead of messing with a successful formula for the sequel, co-directors/co-writers Steffen Haars and Flip Van der Kull decided simply to escalate everything. The jokes are dumber and more offensive. The set pieces are bigger, louder, and gorier. Some may find the constant references to rivalries between Dutch villages—what's up with the dudes from Woensel?—and deep-fried snacks perplexing. However, neither an intimate understanding of Dutch culture nor the original film is a requirement because NEW KIDS NITRO speaks the universal language of ultra-foul politically incorrect humor.
