    "description": "Jos is about to have a very bad day. He knows this because he has just woken up with a splitting headache, a big blank where his previous days' memories should be, a gun beneath his pillow and an unrecognizable corpse in bed next to him. There are, of course, also the gangsters who insist he has twenty kilograms of their cocaine, cocaine Jos neither remembers nor has in his possession. And, oh yes, there's also the small matter of his fianceÃÅ calling to remind him of the final errands that need running before their wedding the next morning.",
