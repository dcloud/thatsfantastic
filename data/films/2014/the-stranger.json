    "description": "Eli Roth's cinematic family tree is growing, from sponsoring and encouraging filmmakers he's discovered at horror conventions (GRACE's Paul Solet) to developing talent ready to take the next step into the show. In 2012, Fantastic Fest showcased the US premiere of Roth collaborator Nicolás López earthquake thriller AFTERSHOCK, and this year will feature Guillermo Amoedo's English language debut THE STRANGER. López and Amoedo worked with Roth on 2013 FF favorite THE GREEN INFERNO as well as his upcoming KNOCK KNOCK.\n\nAmoedo shows a deft ability to turn a bloodthirsty monster movie on its head, into a slow-burn, character-driven film. THE STRANGER takes its time, building the tension through occasional flashbacks and having the audience sympathize with Peter, who grew up not knowing his father. Peter, like the audience, is kept largely in the dark about his father's motives or even what he is... because he's certainly not human. What is apparent is the chaos his dad's return has on the small town, especially a member of the police force and his violence-prone son.\n\nTHE STRANGER is ultimately about family, the legacy we pass on to our children and the lengths we go to protect and ensure their survival, no matter how dark and deadly they might become. (James Shapiro)\n\nGuillermo Amoedo (Director), Nicolás López (Executive Producer), Cristobal Tapia Montt (Actor), Aaron Burns (Actor), Nicolas Duran (Actor)",
