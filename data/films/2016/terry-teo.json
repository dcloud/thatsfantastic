    "description": "Teenaged Terry Teo may not have much, but he knows what he wants and he knows how he's going to get it. Raised poor by his hard-working single mother in the shadow of local gangsters, Terry wants a taste of the good life. And he's going to get it by stealing.\n\nBut everything changes for the skateboarding cat burglar when his estranged father – a cop dedicated to bringing down the gangsters Terry aspires to join – is slain in the streets, and Terry realizes that his picture of the world may not be quite right. So with the help of his martial arts master sister and their friends, he switches sides to carry on his father's work in his own distinct style.\n\nHOUSEBOUND writer/director Gerard Johnstone makes his return with this revival of the classic New Zealand kids adventure icon. Originally appearing in a local hit novel in 1982, Terry Teo made his first appearance on New Zealand television in 1985. The sort of classic character that appeals across all age boundaries, Johnstone presents Teo as a sort of roguishly charming criminal Hardy Boy with the energy of a live action Scooby Doo. Gun runners are no match for this skateboarding charmer and his kung fu fighting sister. How could they possibly counter that rakish grin?\n\nFantastic Fest is proud to present four episodes of the revival's six-part run. Come prepared to load up on breakfast cereal and sugary treats and recapture the feeling of classic Saturday morning adventure. (Todd Brown)",
