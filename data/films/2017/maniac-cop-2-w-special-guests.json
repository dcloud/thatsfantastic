    "description": "Rare archival 35mm screening sponsored by AGFA\n\nLet's look at the facts: MANIAC COP 2 is quite truly The Greatest '80s Horror-Action Movie Ever Made. Violent, whiplash-paced, supernatural and completely insane. It was written by horror legend Larry Cohen and stars Robert Davi, Laurene Landon, Robert Z'Dar, Bruce Campbell and even the lady who played the indestructible dancer in THE HIDDEN. You don't need to have seen the previous installment as the basics are quickly recapped and this film definitely stands on its own.\n\nI know it's our job to tell you that the movies we play are good, but this is coming from my heart: DO NOT MISS THIS. Especially because legendary writer/creator Larry Cohen (IT'S ALIVE; THE STUFF) and action/horror star Laurene Landon (HUNDRA; AMERICA 3000) will be here IN PERSON to vaporize us with stories of the glorious era of video age exploitation. Typing this, I am overwhelmed with the ultimate confidence in MANIAC COP 2's power to entertain you beyond all reason.\n\nIf you like horror movies or just enjoy having fun in any way, BE THERE, DAMN IT. (Zack Carlson)\n\nLarry Cohen, Laurene Landon",
