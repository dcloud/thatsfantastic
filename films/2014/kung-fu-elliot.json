    "raw_body": "Brief Summary\n\n\tA hilarious and disturbing documentary about a man\u2019s quest to become an international action star.\n\nFull Description\n\n\tElliot \u201cWhite Lightning\u201d Scott is a man of many talents. This Nova Scotia native is a martial artist, a director, a special effects technician and Sinophile. Known throughout the region for films such as BLOOD FIGHT and THEY KILLED MY CAT, Elliot's ultimate goal is to become Canada\u2019s \u201cfirst action star.\u201d He spends all of his time\u2014and all of his girlfriend Linda\u2019s money\u2014in an attempt to make this dream come true. However, Elliot is not the person that he seems to be.\n\n\tInitially, KUNG FU ELLIOT seems like yet another documentary about a deluded amateur filmmaker who wants to become famous. As co-directors Jaret Belliveau and Matt Bauckman peel back the layers of Elliot Scott\u2019s puffery and self-mythology, a more complex and truly bizarre picture emerges. Elliot\u2019s personal narrative is revealed to be mostly based on numerous lies. Some of the lies are large. Some of the lies are small. Most of the lies are just weird. Elliot\u2019s cadre of supporters, especially his best friend, are revealed as strange enablers who prop up his juvenile and perverse fantasy world. At the center of the mayhem is Linda, who is frustrated by Elliot\u2019s lack of seriousness but is completely supportive of his endeavors. The arc of this true-life story is unpredictable and the conclusion, in which Elliot\u2019s entire facade collapses before the audience\u2019s eyes, is genuinely shocking. KUNG FU ELLIOT must be seen to be believed. (Rodney Perkins)"
