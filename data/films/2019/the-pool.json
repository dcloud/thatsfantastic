    "description": "Let's be frank: this is essentially an OPEN WATER sequel. In a pool. Without water. But the pool is in Thailand, and it just so happens that a passing crocodile likes the looks of it. Now that we've outlined the premise, add twists and turns and missed opportunities so cleverly engineered that you'll be screaming \"Come ON!\" at the screen in joyous frustration. Saying anything more would be spoiling it, and avoid the trailer if you can! (Granted, I did spoil the croc, but there is so much more bad shit coming at this poor guy that the croc is almost the least of his problems.)\n\nPing Lumpraploeng has crafted a fast-paced nail-biter that offers little relief until the end. He plays as much with his main character as he does with the audience, and has absolutely no problem torturing both. Obviously, filming with a real croc would have been a production nightmare, but I can sincerely say that the quality level of the VFX is pretty remarkable and will give you an indication of what level the South Eastern Asian film industry is playing on. For various reasons, I will disclose here that Lucky the dog should have been named differently; and if there is a message in this film, it would be that when you fall asleep at the pool, you may face far worse dangers than sunburn. (ANNICK MAHNERT)\n\nWith Director Ping Lumpraploeng booked for 2nd half.",
