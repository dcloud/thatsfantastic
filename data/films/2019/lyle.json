    "description": "Stewart Thorndike's masterful queer take on ROSEMARY'S BABY not only imbues Brooklyn with a sense of fear and paranoia, but it also subverts cisgender roles and creates an environment not defined by heteronormative archetypes.\n\nGaby Hoffmann stars as Leah, a young woman who has just moved into a Brooklyn brownstone with her partner June and their toddler, Lyle. It's not long before tragedy strikes; grief slowly turns to suspicion as Leah feels sinister forces at work, setting up the scene for a disquieting confrontation.\n\nThorndike's direction is clever and complex without ever sacrificing efficient storytelling. Her take on Leah and June allows them to exist as complex people reacting to the fear that takes over their senses. Hoffmann is especially striking in a role that demands both control and delivery of high-emotion scenes, not unlike the nuanced portrayal Isabelle Adjani gives in Andrzej Zulawski's POSSESSION.\n\nA disquieting and uneasy experience, LYLE is first and foremost a terrific genre piece which makes full use of its setting and characters to craft a top-rate tale of terror. Add the female perspective that is all too rare within genre as well as the questioning of dictated gender roles, and the end result is both satisfying and unforgettable. Celebrate and marvel at this perfect tale of paranoia whose unforgettable finale will be sure to mark you. (EVRIM ERSOY)\n\nWith Director Stewart Thorndike in Attendance for 1st half.",
