    "description": "Amelia (Essie Davis) has a problem and he is Sam (Noah Wiseman), her son. As his seventh birthday approaches—a day she is unable to celebrate because it happens to be the anniversary of her husband's death. Sam's behavioral problems cause issues with friends and family, leading Amelia to lose more and more sleep. Drifting through a hazy life fighting off grief, guilt and her own flesh and blood, Amelia's motherly instincts are nearly shredded before one night's bedtime story comes in the form of a mysterious and gruesomely detailed pop-up book called \"Mr. Babadook.\" Adding to his already violent outbursts is a new obsessive fear of the titular Babadook, and Sam comes dangerously close to pushing his mother to her breaking point before a knock-knock-knock at the door means the pair might have something more sinister to battle than each other.",
