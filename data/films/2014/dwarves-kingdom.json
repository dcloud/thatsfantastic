    "description": "A quick Google search will reveal several websites calling The Kingdom of Little People one of the world's \"most offensive\" theme parks. The park, located in China, is home to over a hundred performers, all of whom have dwarfism and put on elaborate shows for snapshot-happy tourists. Director Matthew Salton takes his cameras to China to meet with the people living here, as well as with the park's creator and manager, to get a real feel about how those that actually rely on the park for their livelihood feel about the potentially exploitative attraction.\n\nDWARVES KINGDOM takes us inside a rare spot, one most people will only ever gawk at on internet lists, and puts real human faces to a place that is almost hard to believe exists. One resident is very aware of the Kingdom's potential to be seen as a human zoo while its CEO, talking through a smarmy smile, insists his business is based solely on philanthropy. While we can all understand the curious draw of little people, it's hard not to be fascinated by a place built just to allow people to come watch. DWARVES KINGDOM is touching, sometimes funny and—just the way we like them at Fantastic Fest—frequently uncomfortable. (Brian Kelley)\n\n \n\nMatthew Salton (Writer/Director), Verna Hsu (Associate Producer)",
