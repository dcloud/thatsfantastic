    "description": "The Fantastic Fest programming team scours the planet, going to every festival and looking under every rock to find true discoveries. With U.S. distributors being ever more wary to take chances thanks to the streaming market, often the only way to see films like NOBADI is at festivals like FF. Your programmers find them, watch them, love them, and exuberantly share them.\n\nKnowing how few will ever even see these films makes each discovery even more precious, and that's why NOBADI is one of the movies I most adore this year. It's a pretty simple premise we've seen many times before: two people with nothing in common converge by circumstance and are forced to work together. NOBADI takes this basic premise and layers in timely social commentary about refugees and immigration and extreme right-wing ideology, and then it also makes it funny and bizarre and tense and shocking and wonderful.\n\nNOBADI is about two people who spend 24 hours together, changing their lives forever. Their chance meeting is random in a way that can only happen in movies, and what happens to them can only happen specifically in a Fantastic Fest movie. What does that mean? You'll have to take time out of your busy schedule to find out. I'm begging you to do so. This is one of the tiny discoveries we look for and fall in love with, and it's likely the only time you'll get to see this gem of a movie. (JAMES EMANUEL SHAPIRO)",
