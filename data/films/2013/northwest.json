    "description": "Casper (Gustav Dyekjær Gies) is a teenager who lives in one of Copenhagen's poorest neighborhoods: Nordvest. He makes a living by fencing stolen goods for a small time hood named Jamal (Dulfi Al-Jabouri). Eventually, Casper moves on to the big leagues by dealing drugs and joins a crime ring run by Bjørn (Roland Møller). As the money starts rolling in, Casper drags his younger brother (Oscar Dyekjær Giese) into the business. Old grudges resurface, putting Casper and his family into mortal danger.\n\n\nMichael Noer is best known as co-director (with Tobias Lindholm) of the award-winning 2010 prison drama R. With his latest film, Noer shifts his brand of tough realism from a prison environment to the streets of Copenhagen. NORTHWEST is a powerful character-driven work about family bonds, class conflict and ethnic tension. The film boasts a stripped-down approach (e.g., fluid handheld camerawork, actual locations) that squeezes every bit of realism of out the scenario. Excellent naturalistic performances—Gustav and Oscar Dyekjær Gies are real-life brothers whose bond is evident onscreen—heighten the authenticity. NORTHWEST is an exceptional example of a uniquely Danish strain of crime cinema. (Rodney Perkins)",
