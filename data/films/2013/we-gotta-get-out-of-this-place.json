    "description": "Producer Justin Duprie LIVE in attendance!\n\n\nA Texas-lensed feature from brothers Simon & Zeke Hawkins, WE GOTTA GET OUT OF THIS PLACE follows a week in the lives of three friends on the brink of adulthood. Ringleader B.J. (Logan Huffman) is desperate for a final celebratory blow-out before the group disbands for college, so he harmlessly \"borrows\" some cash from the safe at work. Unfortunately, B.J.'s mentally unstable boss is secretly a low-level toadie for a much more dangerous ring of Southern criminals, and the kids' petty theft results in an ever-increasing surge of blunt violence, betrayal and inescapable retribution.\n\n\nThe first full-length work from the Hawkins Brothers is surprisingly confident, balancing the development of compellingly flawed, very human characters with larger-than-life darkness. The film steers between down-home recklessness to sinister sadism to an almost-dreamish state where innocence is maybe only kinda sorta lost forever.\n\n\nThe very able principle cast of young faces is backed by established talents including ROLLING THUNDER's mighty William Devane and Fantastic Fest favorite Jon Gries (SOUTH OF HEAVEN; THE MONSTER SQUAD), who drops his signature good-natured demeanor here to play another nefarious piece of the ever-expanding puzzle. All in all, the film is an emotionally and physically brutal reminder that nothing comes free, life ain't easy, and you should never trust anyoneâ€¦ especially yourself. (Zack Carlson)",
