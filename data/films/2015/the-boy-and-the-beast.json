    "description": "Ren is a nine-year-old kid hiding out from his distant relatives on the streets of Shibuya. His entry into an alternate world ends in an encounter with a bear warrior named Kumatetsu, who offers Ren the chance to become his apprentice. Although Ren is resistant at first, seeing Kumatetsu battle soon changes his mind, and before long, the two have become the unlikeliest of friends.\n\nMamoru Hosada returns to the big screen with yet another uncategorizable tale that'll win over everyone in the audience. THE BOY AND THE BEAST has all the trademarks of a classic Hosada film: a fantasy world which has its roots in reality, populated with richly nuanced, engaging characters whose fates the audience cares deeply about.",
