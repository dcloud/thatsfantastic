Not wanting to give up his custody days to his ex-wife, Jos\u00e9 has also brought his son along, for both the robbery and the ride. Little do they know that this is only the beginning of their troubles. When they decide to make a stop in a small tavern in the Basque countryside, the group encounters a series of local wackos. Falling victim to a mysterious spell, they soon find themselves the honored guests of a fractured family of witches who are preparing for an ancient ritual. More colorful characters begin to enter the picture, including a pair of hapless cops hot on the trail, a defecting vixen witch and Jos\u00e9's controlling ex-wife, and the situation spirals further out of control, heading towards a jaw-dropping climax."
