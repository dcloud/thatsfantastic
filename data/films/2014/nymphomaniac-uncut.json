    "description": "It's a cold snowy night. Seligman (Stellan Skarsgård) leaves his home to buy some groceries. On his way home, he comes across a woman named Joe (Charlotte Gainsbourg), lying bloody and beaten in an alley. Joe initially resists his offer of aid, but she soon relents. Once the pair retreat to Seligman's home, a conversation ensues. He's understandably curious about Joe and how she ended up in the alley. Thus begins a bizarre multi-hour conversation in which Joe reveals her life-long pursuit of sexual satisfaction and personal destruction.\n\nNYMPHOMANIAC is the final film in Lars Von Trier's \"Depression\" trilogy, the first two films being ANTICHRIST and MELANCHOLIA. Its core is a sprawling digressive conversation between Joe and Seligman. She breaks her life story into eight chapters. Various characters—who are played by diverse range of actors including Stacy Martin, Shia LaBeouf, Christian Slater, Willem Dafoe and Uma Thurman—appear throughout her wild tales. Seligman listens intently to her litany of perversions. While doing so, he asks questions and explores the larger implications of her deeds. He relates her stories to such divergent topics as music, art, mathematics, philosophy and fly fishing. Yes, fly fishing. The various themes and patterns eventually converge with devastating impact. It's a bold—and frankly crazy—concept that Von Trier executes with characteristic skill and technical exactness. NYMPHOMANIAC is perverse, offensive, funny, and challenging in the rarest of ways.
