With encouragement from her friend Madeline (Stéphane Bissot), Gloria goes on an Internet date with a handsome man named Michel (Laurent Lucas). Unbeknownst to her, her date is not a normal fellow. This is demonstrated as Michel conducts a black magic ritual to ensure that Gloria succumbs to his charms. The ritual seems to have the intended effect as Gloria and Michel quickly fall in love. Despite the initial sparks, Michel mysteriously disappears after a few weeks. Gloria becomes obsessed with Michel's whereabouts and tracks him down. She discovers that Michel is leading many different lives with many different women. However, Gloria doesn't care; she will do anything to be with Michel, including commit murder.",
