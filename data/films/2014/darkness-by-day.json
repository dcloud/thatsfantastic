That is, until her cousin Anabel, who also seems to be under the weather, is brought and left with her. Thankful for another person to talk to, Virginia makes every effort to keep Anabel comfortable and to bond with her. Anabel sleeps most of the day, and at night can be found wandering the woods alone. The radio reports a rabies outbreak in the remote region of Argentina where the women are holed up. In this perpetual shadow of impending doom, Virginia and her cousin are left to face the darkness of things to come."
