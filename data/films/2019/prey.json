    "description": "Standing out as a beautiful oddity amidst the slew of '70s British exploitation films, PREY is unusual not only in its treatment of the central lesbian couple but also the queer sexual politics that pervade every frame of the film. Add to this an oppressive and uneasy atmosphere that threatens to tip the film into violence at any given moment, and what you have is a little-seen but incredibly adept exploration of gender politics and warfare that could comfortably sit next to films like Joseph Losey's THE SERVANT.\n\nJosephine and Jessica are a couple living in an isolated country house with a host of relationship problems: Josephine is possessive and jealous and Jessica is having second thoughts about the whole thing. Into this conflict comes Anders, a shape-shifting alien with malicious intent who has chosen this couple as his observational subjects. What follows is a series of increasingly violent games — both verbal and physical — where the lines between the hunter and the hunted are frayed to the point of invisibility.\n\nWith a gorgeous synth score by Ivor Slaney, PREY is one of the most unusual examples of queer cinema to emerge within mainstream genre film. With its complex central characters, exceptional character work, and razor-sharp dissection of relationships, the decades-old feature remains a provocative big-screen experience. (EVRIM ERSOY)",
