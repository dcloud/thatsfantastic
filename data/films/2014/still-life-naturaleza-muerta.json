    "description": "A small Argentinian town is plagued by a series of brutal murders. One of the victims is a cattle industry scion named Julia Cotonese (played by Mercedes Oviedo). An ambitious journalist named Jazmin (Luz Cipriot) is looking for an opportunity to advance her career. While investigating Julia's murder, she finds that all of the murders share something in common: the victims are all tied to the local beef industry. Numerous suspects arise, including a radical environmental group that's been papering the town with pamphlets. As Jazmin's investigation deepens and she gets closer to a solution, she inevitably enters the killer's path.",
