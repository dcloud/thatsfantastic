    "description": "Ralph is a 12-year-old boy who just got a new video camcorder from his parents and now spends his days recording himself goofing around with his pal Josh. He also discovers from his Dad that he can hook it up to the TV to record his favorite late night shows and the wondrous commercials that air between.\n\nDirector Jack Henry Robbins and writer Nunzio Randazzo clearly have a deep affection for the 1980s, and especially the demented television shows and their scraggly commercials that permeated the era's airwaves. In VHYES, Robbins has assembled a veritable who's who to bring to life his demented version of the idiot box, including notables like his parents Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon, Thomas Lennon, Charlyne Yi, Madeline Zima, and Kerri Kenney.\n\nWhile visiting the eerily familiar shows of many a Gen Xer's youth is one hell of a journey, you'll also experience a shrewdly woven insight into a formative week in the psyche of our young hero, Ralph. If every known media was on a VHS tape in a midwest Blockbuster in 1987, VHYES would exist on a shelf alongside the sketches of Tim & Eric, the late night Adult Swim works of Alan Resnick, and the pop culture send-ups of Vernon Chatman. So fire up your VCR and get ready to journey back into the magic airwaves of the past with VHYES! (NOAH LEE)\n\nWith Director Jack Henry Robbins, Actress Kerri Kenney, and Actor/Executive Producer Tim Robbins in Attendance.",
