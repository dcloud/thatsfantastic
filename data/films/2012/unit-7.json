    "description": "The year is 1987. The location is the Spanish city of Seville. In a few years, people from all over the world will descend on the city for Expo '92. In anticipation of the international publicity, Seville's government initiates wide-sweeping changes, including a plan to flush the streets of drugs and prostitution. Angel (Mario Casas from NEON FLESH), a young cop trying to rise in the ranks, is assigned to the anti-drug squad: the titular Unit 7. Angel is a rube amongst a group of rough vets, including Rafeal (Antonio De La Torre from THE LAST CIRCUS and VOLVER); Miguel (Jose Manuel Poga); and Matthew. The group takes up the mandate to clean up Seville's slums with zealous brutality. Their smash-mouth tactics yield big successes but also create serious problems that may prove beyond the group's ability to control.\n\nBased on real events, UNIT 7 successfully invokes the gritty, character-driven American police thrillers of the 70s. However, instead of simply mimicking other films, Rodriguez adds a fresh spin on the formula. At its core, UNIT 7 is an exploration of the dynamic between four wildly differing personalities operating in an intense pressurized environment. Angel wants to build a career so he can care for his wife and child. Rafael is deeply religious yet extremely violent. Miguel is a bigoted hot head; Matthew is a hypocrite. This intense group dynamic is the source of the film's explosive energy and violence. UNIT 7 is a confident powerful work from a talented director. (Rodney Perkins)",
