    "description": "Part celebration, part behind-the-scenes footage, but all new and brilliant material, Lisa Downs' documentary LIFE AFTER FLASH is a perfect example of what a filmmaker can achieve with a beloved cult classic and an incredible story that has never been told.\n\nSam J. Jones is best known as the man who played Flash Gordon, but the true extent of his life story is more intricate, complicated, and touching than anyone could guess. From his meteoric rise to catastrophic fall and his journey back, his story is 100% universal: an authentic man who overcomes obstacles to truly find himself.\n\nA plethora of perspectives — FLASH GORDON cast members, Brian May from Queen, fans, and production crew — add texture and fun as they share stories that make you roar with laughter or sit open-mouthed in astonishment.\n\nPractically a blueprint on what it takes to build a cult film, as well as an examination of how that film survives and the impact it has on those involved, LIFE AFTER FLASH is a true journey into the heart of cinema and what makes it great. (EVRIM ERSOY)\n\nWith Director Lisa Downs and Actor Sam J. Jones in Attendance.",
