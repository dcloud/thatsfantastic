Adapted by Alexandre Aja (HIGH TENSION; PIRANHA) from Joe Hill\u2019s novel.\n\nFull Description\n\n\tIn the opening scene, Ig (Radcliffe) foreshadows, \u201cWhen you go through Hell, the only way out is to walk deeper through the fire.\u201d Since he\u2019s been unanimously accused of raping and murdering his longtime girlfriend Marren (Juno Temple, seemingly named from the EXORCIST priest), Ig can only wonder how much deeper into the fire he can go. He wakes up one morning with horns growing from his head and strange new powers, including the ability to have anyone tell them their darkest truths (\u201cI\u2019ve never been with a jigaboo before,\u201d a neighbor says). Ig also has the skill to make them act on these desires. He\u2019s initially appalled by this development, but the opportunity to use these powers to find out the truth in Marren\u2019s death is a dance with the devil that\u2019s too good to pass up.\n\n\tHORNS skillfully navigates several genres and themes: fantasy, religious drama, detective mystery, and it takes the basic structure one sees in superhero origin stories. Aja does a strong job combining all of this, but the heart and backbone of HORNS is a love story. Ig is hellbent on finding who murdered the love of his life while his community is out to lynch him for the very crime that destroyed him. Many flashbacks are given to Ig and Marren, which scope out their entire relationship, elevating the film beyond its dark nature. She was his Garden of Eden, and that drives everything about the film.\n\n\tWith three superstars behind it\u2014actor Daniel Radcliffe, director Alex Aja and novelist Joe Hill\u2014HORNS is one of the genre event films of 2014.
