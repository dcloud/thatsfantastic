    "description": "Nicolas Winding Refn burst onto the film scene in the late 1990s with the delightfully nasty PUSHER trilogy, and has continued to produce some of the most thought-provoking and visually spectacular genre-benders of any modern auteur. From Tom Hardy's career-defining titular Bronson to Mads Mikkelsen's feral One Eye to Ryan Gosling's icy cold Driver, Refn has time and again crafted nuanced portraits of deeply conflicted but undeniably charismatic antiheroes.",
