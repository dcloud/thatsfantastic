    "description": "ABCs OF DEATH 2 is the follow-up to the most ambitious anthology film ever conceived with productions spanning from Nigeria to UK to Brazil and everywhere in between. It features segments directed by over two dozen of the world's leading talents in contemporary genre film. Inspired by children's educational books, the motion picture is comprised of twenty-six individual chapters; each helmed by a different director assigned a letter of the alphabet.  The directors were then given free reign in choosing a word to create a story involving death. Provocative, shocking, funny and at times confrontational, ABCs OF DEATH 2 is another global celebration of next generation genre filmmaking.\n\nAfter it's release on home-video and especially Netflix, the first film evolved into the equivalent of a celluloid boogeyman with viewers daring each other via social media to check out the film. Others chose to play drinking games while watching with participants trying to guess what each letter stood for.\n\nWe sincerely hope ABCs OF DEATH 2 is as much as a raucous party as the first film proved to be with audiences around the world.\n\nRodney Ascher (Director), Julian Barratt (Director), Robert Boocheck (Director), Alejandro Brugues (Director), Claudia Calviño (Segment Executive Producer), Pat Daniel (Segment Actor), Larry Fessenden (Director), Jeremy Gillespie (Segment Writer), Jim Hosking (Director), Shannon Hanmer (Segment Producer), Lancelot Imasuen (Director), Aharon Kashales (Director), Evan Katz (Director), Peter Katz (Segment Producer), Steven Kostanski (Director), Peter Kuplowsky (Segment Producer), Don Le (Segment Producer), Lauren Molina (Segment Writer, Producer), Nicholas Musurca (Segment Writer, Producer), Mai Nakanishi (Segment Producer), Chris Nash (Director), Navot Papushado (Director), Morgan Patterson (Segment Producer), Mariana Ramos (Segment Production Coordinator), Tristan Risk (Segment Actor), Todd Rohal (Director), Jerome Sable (Director), Jen Soska (Director), Sylvia Soska (Director), Andy Starke (Segment Producer), Bruno Samper (Director), Soichi Umezawa (Director), Jennifer Wexler (Segment Producer), Marc Walkow, Mitch Davis, Ant Timpson, Tim Riley, Ted Geoghegan, Todd Brown",

    "synopsis": "In 2013 the craziest anthology ever created was released to an unsuspecting public. It immediately divided audiences. Some claimed it was a much-needed adrenaline shot to the heart of genre film, while others claimed it was reprehensible and the death knell of cinema as we know it.\n\nIn 2014 it's happening again. This time with an all-new line-up of international directors. Twenty-six NEW directors. Twenty-six NEW ways to die.",
