    "description": "In Jim Mickle's brilliant hybrid of science fiction and thriller, Boyd Holbrook stars as a Philadelphia police officer who finds himself on the hunt for a strange serial killer after a series of murders shake the city to its core. As his investigations lead him further down the rabbit hole, a pattern emerges within the crimes, and soon the stakes become infinitely larger and more personal.\n\nRecalling the prime of '80s big screen sci-fi, IN THE SHADOW OF THE MOON is an exciting ride that never fails to respect its setting or its characters. Working with an incredible cast including the wonderful Michael C. Hall and Bokeem Woodbine, Mickle's astute direction imbues the action with a real place and time.\n\nWithout ever taking his eye off the questions the film is asking, Mickle finds a way to explore the obsessions at play at the core of this story. IN THE SHADOW OF THE MOON shows a talent working at the top of his game, bending and blending genres with ease, examining pertinent ideas that go way beyond the final frame. IN THE SHADOW OF THE MOON is love letter and evolution blasted into one. (EVRIM ERSOY)\n\nWith Director Jim Mickle and Actors Boyd Holbrook, Michael C. Hall, and Cleopatra Coleman in Attendance for 1st half.",
