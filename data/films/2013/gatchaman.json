    "description": "One of the most popular and enduring anime series ever made, SCIENCE NINJA TEAM GATCHAMAN\u2013 known variously in English as BATTLE OF THE PLANETS and G-FORCE \u2013 has proven hugely popular around the globe for forty years now, the adventures of its colorfully costumed future ninjas as they fight for the safety of the Earth enthralling children \u2013 and former children \u2013 around the world. It's so popular, in fact, that it's really quite surprising that it's taken this long for a live action version to hit the big screen.\n\nVeteran TV director Toya Sato takes the helm in this latest incarnation of the GATCHAMAN story, one that pits the Gatchaman team against their regular arch-villains, the Galactors - an alien force here to conquer the Earth and strip it of its resources. The only hope in the fight against the alien incursion is a small group of humans able to draw power from mysterious ancient crystals that grant enough strength to defeat the Galactor forces. Cue five teen heroes to the rescue and Science Ninja Team Gatchaman is born.\n\nOur bird-themed heroes are brought to vivid life by a team of Japan's best technicians and VFX artists for a film that clearly aims to be the start of a new, long-running franchise. And, hey, when you're fusing elements of ninja action with giant mecha and alien invaders, why not? No matter which of these five heroes you dreamt of being as a child (*cough*, Joe) this'll take you back to those childhood fantasies. (Todd Brown)",
