    "description": "After escaping from prison, Ram贸n heads for a mysterious village where a fellow inmate claims to have hidden a stash of stolen jewels years earlier. Nestled deep within the twisted and foreboding woods of Galicia, Spain and positioned along a well-worn pilgrimage route, the village is a secluded and traditions-obsessed relic of ancient times. Its inhabitants take a peculiar interest in travelers passing through and the local church cleric Don Cesareo is quick to integrate Ram贸n into his flock, annoyingly preventing him from paying a visit to the house where his treasure awaits. When night falls and Ram贸n witnesses the entire village disappearing into the confines of the church, his curiosity is piqued. But Ram贸n will quickly discover that he has stumbled upon a place where archaic legends are reality and he may never be able to leave.",
