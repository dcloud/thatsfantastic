    "description": "Victor is, in many ways, a broken man. You can argue about whether it was the French Foreign Legion that broke him, or the Algerian occupation, or some combination of the two, but the end result is that—now freshly returned home to the Paris of the 1960s—Victor is just not comfortable in his own skin. He's no longer himself. And so work as a masked wrestler carries obvious appeal. His old friend Simon, who makes a living as a minor hero on a low level wrestling circuit, is just the man to get him in.",
