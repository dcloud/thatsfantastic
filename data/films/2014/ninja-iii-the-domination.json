    "description": "Screening in a beautiful 35mm print in conjunction with CANNON FILMS / ELECTRIC BOOGALOO.\n\nBefore you go and throw some damn fool fit about how it's unacceptable that Fantastic Fest would run ANY film from the director of BREAKIN' 2, you'd better consider some facts. First off, NINJA III is a straight-up supernatural possession epic; the blue-collar martial arts cousin to the almighty original EXORCIST. Only in this case, lil' Linda Blair is exchanged for high-kicking aerobics instructor Lucinda Dickey, lead actress from (yep) BREAKIN' 2. And her soul is controlled—not by a demon—but by a blood-starved ninja masterbastard bent on vengeance and supreme annihilation.\n\nThe opening golf course slaughterstorm immediately sets the stage for an IQ-shattering attack against all five senses. Oh, and don't worry if you've never seen the two previous NINJA installments… because the folks who made this one sure seem to be in the same boat. (Zack Carlson)",
