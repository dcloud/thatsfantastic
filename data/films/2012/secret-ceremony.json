    "description": "On the way to the graveyard for a visit one day, prostitute Leonora is accosted on a city bus by a waifish weirdo named Cenci (Mia Farrow) who insists that Leonora is her 'missing' mother. Cenci's pleading eyes remind her of her dead daughter, and she concedes to follow the girl to her giant London house, where she immediately spies a picture of the mother in question and understands the confusion â€“ the two women are nearly identical. But in all the family photos, the image of the father is suspiciously blackened out.",
