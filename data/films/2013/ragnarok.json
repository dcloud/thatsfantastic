He believes that a runic inscription on the ship, which translates to \"man knows little,\" holds the key to understanding the Norse myth of Ragnarok: the day when heaven and earth are destroyed. After finding similar inscriptions on a stone in Northern Norway, Sigurd, along with his kids and a colleague, begins an expedition to uncover the secret of the day of doom.\n\nRAGNAROK is a rousing action adventure film in the style of '80s Hollywood summer blockbusters. All the traditional adventure tropes are at play here. However, instead of simply aping American movies, director Mikkel Brænne Sandemose (COLD PREY 3) and writer John Kåre Raake pave a decidedly Nordic path to adventure. The use of Nordic myths and culture in this story injects fresh life into a familiar format. Much of the film takes place in the mountainous border regions between Norway and Russia. The filmmakers use these locations to great effect. Once the story moves the characters from the city to the Norwegian countryside, RAGNAROK takes on a majestic, epic feel. RAGNAROK is visually arresting, emotionally engaging, and most importantly, a whole lot of fun. (Rodney Perkins)",
