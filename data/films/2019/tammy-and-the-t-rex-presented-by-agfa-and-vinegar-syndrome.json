    "description": "It's the 25th Anniversary of 2019's most unbelievable repertory film discovery! Directed by Stewart Raffill — the same genre warrior behind MAC AND ME, THE ICE PIRATES, and MANNEQUIN TWO: ON THE MOVE — TAMMY AND THE T-REX is a love story as old as time.\n\nThis post-JURASSIC jam stars the heavenly combo of Denise Richards (STARSHIP TROOPERS; WILD THINGS) and the late Paul Walker (THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS franchise; SHE'S ALL THAT) in an unprecedented mishmash of rom-com tropes and R-rated horror thrills. When Paul is mauled by the local zoo's toothier residents, his love affair with Denise doesn't cease — even after his brain is transplanted into an ancient animatronic predator. Oh, and did we mention Terry Kiser (\"Bernie\" from WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S) is the villain?\n\nOriginally filmed as a crimson-soaked gorefest (with impressive splatter by recently deceased SFX guru John Carl Buechler), TAMMY's only minimal release back in the day was cut to PG-13, funneled straight-to-video, and inexplicably marketed as a \"kids' film.\" Now, thanks to the intrepid efforts of top-notch archival pals Vinegar Syndrome, this gonzo gem is sure to tickle both casual observers and longtime fans of dino-carnage.\n\nFrom Denise Richards' fully committed performance to the T-Rex disemboweling stoners at a late-nite dance party, this movie is exactly what life will be like after the world ends and we lose all hope for anything that isn't TAMMY AND THE T-REX. Now fully restored and ready to scorch your ganglia into dust! (BRET BERG)",
