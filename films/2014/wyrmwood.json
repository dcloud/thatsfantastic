And what this brother act deliver is one of the most balls-out and fabulously entertaining entries into the zombie canon in years.\n\n\tWhen falling stars bring a mysterious plague onto the land, transforming all but a select few into ravenous, bloodthirsty monsters, gruff-but-kind family man Barry is left with no family but his sister Brooke stranded hours away, with hundreds of the ravenous beasts between them. But with nothing left to live for except his sister, Barry\u2019s not going to let anything stand in his way; not the undead and certainly not the military forces who may be even more dangerous than the creatures they\u2019re supposedly protecting people from.\n\n\tBy adding intriguing new elements to the zombie mythos, along with a heaping dose of MAD MAX-inspired vehicular modification and an enormous serving of pure, raw talent, the Roache-Turner Brothers deliver one cracking piece of entertainment loaded with scares, gore and off-kilter comedy for one of the most auspicious debuts since\u2026 well, since a certain other Australian brother act appeared on the scene with UNDEAD. Yes, they really are that good. (Todd Brown)"
