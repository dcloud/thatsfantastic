He makes a living by fencing stolen goods for a small time hood named Jamal (Dulfi Al-Jabouri). Eventually, Casper moves on to the big leagues by dealing drugs and joins a crime ring run by Bjørn (Roland Møller). As the money starts rolling in, Casper drags his younger brother (Oscar Dyekjær Giese) into the business. Old grudges resurface, putting Casper and his family into mortal danger.",
