A young woman working a nothing job to finance her artistic endeavors, she has been plagued by nightmares for god knows how long; vivid and horrible things that plunge her into past trauma. Her only outlet is the increasingly outrageous artistic project and alter egos that may very well isolate Amy from her few remaining friends, but at least they also provide some distance from the pain. Then Amy meets Kenny, who\u2019s kind and gentle and understanding, and for a moment, it appears as though life could get better.\n\n\tA gifted cinematographer who has shot for Jonathan Caouette and Adrian Grenier, Jason Banker burst onto the director scene in 2012 with his debut feature TOAD ROAD. It was immediately obvious that Banker was a unique voice. Heavily employing documentary and improvisational techniques, Banker\u2019s work defies easy categorization on many levels, resisting easy genre and style labels. In another time, he may have been tempted to sign on with the Dogme 95 crew by Banker\u2019s work is more cinematic than Von Trier\u2019s protest movement, with which it shares an emphasis on capturing the truth and essence of the characters and story.\n\n\tWith FELT, Banker proves that TOAD ROAD was no fluke. Banker maintains his fluid balance between intensely uncomfortable intimacy and cinematic flourish, drawing startlingly raw and vulnerable performances from Amy Everson\u2014with whom he developed the story\u2014and Kentucker Audley. We\u2019re witnessing the emergence of a major talent here, and while it\u2019s hard to say where his road will lead him, it\u2019s going to be a fascinating journey.(Todd Brown)"
