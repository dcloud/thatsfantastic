It features segments directed by over two dozen of the world's leading talents in contemporary genre film. Inspired by children’s educational books, the motion picture is comprised of twenty-six individual chapters; each helmed by a different director assigned a letter of the alphabet.  The directors were then given free reign in choosing a word to create a story involving death. Provocative, shocking, funny and at times confrontational, ABCs OF DEATH 2 is another global celebration of next generation genre filmmaking.\n\nAfter it’s release on home-video and especially Netflix, the first film evolved into the equivalent of a celluloid boogeyman with viewers daring each other via social media to check out the film. Others chose to play drinking games while watching with participants trying to guess what each letter stood for.\n\nWe sincerely hope ABCs OF DEATH 2 is as much as a raucous party as the first film proved to be with audiences around the world.\n\nAdditional Credits:\nJeremy Gillespie (Segment Writer)\nShannon Hanmer (Segment Producer)\nPeter Katz (Segment Producer)\nPeter Kuplowsky (Segment Producer)\nLauren Molina (Segment Writer, Producer)\nNicholas Musurca (Segment Producer)\nAndy Starke (Segment Producer)\nDon Le (Segment Producer)\nPat Daniel (Segment Actor)\nTristan Risk (Segment Actor)\nClaudia Calviño (Segment Executive Producer)\nMariana Ramos (Segment Production Coordinator)",

With encouragement from her friend Madeline (Stéphane Bissot), Gloria goes on an Internet date with a handsome man named Michel (Laurent Lucas). Unbeknownst to her, her date is not a normal fellow. This is demonstrated as Michel conducts a black magic ritual to ensure that Gloria succumbs to his charms. The ritual seems to have the intended effect as Gloria and Michel quickly fall in love. Despite the initial sparks, Michel mysteriously disappears after a few weeks. Gloria becomes obsessed with Michel’s whereabouts and tracks him down. She discovers that Michel is leading many different lives with many different women. However, Gloria doesn’t care; she will do anything to be with Michel, including commit murder.\r\n\r\nALLELUIA is the second film in Fabrice du Welz’s proposed trilogy about the Belgian Ardennes. The first installment, CALVAIRE, is one of the best horror films of the early 2000s. Loosely based on the true story of Martha Beck and Raymond Fernandez (aka the Honeymoon Killers), ALLELUIA is an intense, darkly comedic thriller about an extremely rotten romance. The story of Gloria and Michel is told in four chapters, each of which is focused on a specific crime. Each offense is worse than the last, leading to a violent finale that will leave the viewer gasping for air. Every single element of this film—direction, performances, cinematography—is executed with precision and clarity. (Rodney Perkins)",

As Regina attempts to put together a complicated story for her readers, Shetty's viewers are taken on a whirlwind journey through the Karnataka underworld, and introduced to the vividly written and realized characters who make up its inhabitants. Director Shetty deftly hides the focus of the story while managing to engage the audience in the lives of various big and small time hoods, nobodies in love, and a vivid cast of characters all in need of anything to make their lives make sense.\n\nA wonderfully vibrant and engaging Indian take on the classic non-linear crime story, AS SEEN BY THE REST is both an easily identifiable offspring of its greatest influences and a creation all its own. With explicit references to well-known crime stories like SCARFACE and PULP FICTION, the film functions more like a retelling of RASHOMON, bathed in the colorful expressions of Karnataka's religious fervor during the festival of Sri Krishna Janmaashtami. The city is drenched in the colors of celebration, but a blood-red stain leaves its residents wondering what happened and who is to blame.\n\nThis is a milestone for Karnataka cinema, one of the first films in the Kannada language to break out from Bengaluru theaters to the world outside. Rakshit Shetty presents us with a film that is never less than rapturous in its embrace of cinema and its effect on the collective consciousness of its fans. In addition to directing the film, Shetty also wrote and starred in it, alongside a number of other vibrant and colorful characters.(Josh Hurtado)",

Refusing to step outside, her only connections to the outside world are the dreams and fantasies with which she fills her days. These thoughts soon threaten to overthrow the comfortable cage Ingrid has put herself in and force her to look deeper inside herself for an answer for her problems.\n\nLike ‘Vanishing Waves’ before it, ‘BLIND’ is a genre-defying attempt to harmonise the internal and the external - on one hand Ingrid, expertly played by Ellen Dorrit Petersen , is a highly isolated character - paranoid at times, highly elusive at others - and yet her astute understanding of the world around her acts as continious commentary on what the audience sees creating a sense of engagement which many other films lack. Add to this mix the entirely plausible characters which populate the world around her and what you get is a smart but engaging genre film which will appeal to anyone who is seeking something beyond the norm.\n\nBLIND is a visual poem, a clever construct which is visually stunning and emotionally complex. Debut helmer Eskil Vogt creates a multi-layered world in which nothing is what it seems. The deeper Ingrid delves into her own thoughts, the more engaging and three-dimensional a visual world the audience encounters. Full of funny visual gags and hard-hitting emotional truths, BLIND is a film like no other - it taunts whilst it teases and amuses while it challenges.\n\nSee it, debate it and fall in love with it.(Evrim Ersoy)",

After taking the prize for best directors in the 2011 Gutbuster Comedy Features category, Haars and van der Kull return to Austin with their sickest comedy to date: BROs BEFORE HOs.\r\n\r\nHere, the directors apply their politically incorrect style of humor to an unexpected format: the bromance. Although the format is different from NEW KIDS and the production values are arguably better, the humor has arguably gotten more aggro and offensive. No subject is taboo; race, sex, and disability are prime targets for the comedic onslaught. BROs BEFORE HOs is packed with enough explosively offensive humor to make the NEW KIDS films seem restrained.

He has done so in secret, fearing the response that may follow if news were to leak out prematurely and without careful management.

While it may be too soon to call it a movement, Senese’s approach puts him in good company with recent efforts such as Zack Parker’s PROXY and Eron Sheean’s ERRORS OF THE HUMAN BODY as—if not a wave then at least a ripple—of filmmakers blurring genre conventions to challenge the increasingly murky and conflicted ethics of our polarized age.\n\nLike the films mentioned above, the great strength of Senese’s work here lies in the fact that the fiction of his tale is not the science itself (which is perfectly plausible), while the interest is not showing off fancy technological innovations but in exploring how our current technological abilities impact—for lack of a better word—our souls.

But Martin's troubles are just beginning. When he wakes up in the hospital, the police believe that he was the one who killed everyone at the cabin. Not only that, but the doctors have accidentally reattached the wrong limb, giving him Herzog's arm instead of his own. Martin goes on the run with both the police and the Nazis after him, while Herzog's arm tries to kill everyone he meets.\n\nBut the Nazis have bigger plans and Martin must find a way to defeat them. When a child turns him on to the Zombie Squad, a group of professional zombie hunters from America, Martin enlists their help to stop Herzog. The Americans fly to Norway to fight alongside Martin in the ultimate showdown of man vs. Nazi zombie.\n\nWith nods to classic horror films like EVIL DEAD 2, DEAD SNOW 2 is exactly what you want from a movie about Nazi zombies. It's consistently funny and never takes itself too seriously. Full of cheese and ridiculousness, this is a completely over-the-top blood-soaked carnival of craziness.(Luke Mullen)",

      "long_description": "Cousins Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus helped to create the modern Israeli film industry with titles such as OPERATION THUNDERBOLT and LEMON POPSICLE (later remade as THE LAST AMERICAN VIRGIN). During the ‘80s, Golan and Globus set up shop in Hollywood by purchasing The Cannon Group. Dismal titles such as THE APPLE quickly gained Cannon Group a reputation as purveyors of rotten movies. Despite the criticism, the pair kept pushing forward. The persistence paid off when Cannon released BREAKIN’, which was rushed through production in order to beat its East Coast rival BEAT STREET. Bolstered by that film’s success, Golan and Globus went on to produce a stunningly eclectic array of films, ranging from straight-up genre (INVASION USA; DEATH WISH 3; LIFEFORCE) to more esteemed fare (KING LEAR; BARFLY; LOVE STREAMS). A combination of commercial misfires and poorly executed business moves in the ‘90s led to the company’s collapse, but the Cannon legacy remains strong in the hearts of many fans.\n\nAs demonstrated by NOT QUITE HOLLYWOOD and MACHETE MAIDENS UNLEASHED, Mark Hartley has one of the most interesting and identifiable styles of any documentary filmmaker currently in the business. ELECTRIC BOOGALOO: THE WILD UNTOLD STORY OF CANNON FILMS further demonstrates this point. Harley expertly weaves together clips from Cannon's back catalog with an impressive array of interviews with Cannon players such as Albert Pyun, Boaz Davidson, Cassandra Peterson (Elvira), Bo Derek and Michael Dudikoff. The result is a whiplash-inducing ride through decades of exploitation cinema and high-rolling business deals. ELECTRIC BOOGALOO is an exciting and irreverent homage to a pair of the greatest businessmen that the film world has ever known. (Rodney Perkins)",

A call girl by trade, Everly has turned against her gangster boss Taiko (Hiroyuki Watanabe) and become a police informant. In response, Taiko has put out a hit on Everly and her family. Soon, every criminal in town wants to cash in. Everly’s survival instincts quickly kick in as she matches wits and firepower with Taiko and a seemingly endless stream of killers.\n\nJoe Lynch is best known as the director of films such as WRONG TURN 2 and KNIGHTS OF BADASSDOM. With EVERLY, Lynch—working from a screenplay by Yale Hannon—sets off in a very different direction from his prior works. Displaying a diverse array of influences—particularly the cinema of Takashi Miike—he delivers a stylish pulpy action film with a massive body count and a whole lot of black humor. EVERLY mostly takes place within the confines of the titular character’s apartment but the film never seems constrained by physical space. Instead, it unfolds at a relentless pace as Lynch unleashes surprise after violent surprise upon the viewer.\n\nSalma Hayek dominates the screen with an intense physical performance that makes one wonder why she isn’t cast as a lead in more action movies. In addition to meeting the physical demands of the role, Hayek brings serious pathos and sympathy to the film’s heroine. EVERLY is a furious dose of fist-pumping action that will leave the audience cheering. (Rodney Perkins)",

It is a clause that is put into contracts that frees both parties of responsibility, an unavoidable accident, or, quite simply an act of God.\n\nIn a remote ski resort full of rich tourists in the French Alps, an unsuspecting Swedish family is about to come up against such an event. While sitting at lunch one day, they notice an avalanche beginning to roll down the side of a nearby mountain. Responding with his first instinct, Tomas, the father of the group, flees the table, leaving his wife and children to fend for themselves. After assessing that no bodily damage has been done, the family tries to go on enjoying their holiday, but it is not long before they are having awkward dinner conversations with strangers and strained interactions about the way they separately perceive how events played out.\n\nCoupling intelligence with aesthetics, director Ruben Östlund presents a biting satire of masculinity. Peppered with surrealist sequences, the atmospheric film uses the imposing landscape to build images of a white abyss that one can lose themself in while the blasting Vivaldi score is reminiscent of the most powerful sequences in films like Lars von Trier’s Melancholia.\n\nWhile not strictly a genre movie, Force Majeure deals with something much more real and horrifying. Östlund, who has made a career for himself out of cinematic morality tales, applies his scathing wit to these scenarios and creates a kind of psychological nightmare for his characters, one in which the humor and pain of their world’s unraveling is so palpable that it is cringe inducing to watch, but the results are far too relatable to look away.

She decides to apply her knowledge of lucid dreaming to find the source of the horrible visions.\n\nRomain Basset’s feature-length debut is a visually stunning and highly original horror film. There are obvious precedents—Fulci and Argento immediately come to mind—but HORSEHEAD (FIEVRE) is neither an homage nor replication of a previous style. The film is structured around the contrast between everyday reality and the horrors of nightmares. There’s a compelling and clearly defined story that effortlessly switches between the real and the surreal without becoming abstract or incoherent. Totally unique and still mindful of the earlier attempts within the genre, HORSEHEAD combines a dream logic with the still logic of reality in a mindwarp which, without confusing the viewer, still serves as one hell of a trip. It’s a story told clearly, working with the use of powerful imagery as well as terrific set pieces which heighten the tension and create a highly-charged environment; the sort of film whose lucid approach enchants and delights in equal measure.\n\nHORSEHEAD is an extremely risky concept that is executed with confidence and skill. It’s an amazing achievement that demands attention from the opening scene to the final frame. (Rodney Perkins)",

But unlike her teen years, when she could simply walk out on mom’s nattering, Kylie’s ankle bracelet ensures she stays in close range of mom at all times, lest she serve out her sentence in prison. But as tedious as her mother’s belief in the supernatural may be, Kylie must face an even worse reality: Her mother may actually be right and that their house (which she can’t legally leave), may actually be haunted.\n\nRemember the name of Gerard Johnstone, because I guarantee you’re going to be hearing a lot more from this talented Kiwi in the future. Blending wry comedy, richly drawn characters and legitimate scares, Johnstone’s HOUSEBOUND is one of the most impressive debut films in years. Johnstone has a rare gift for switching gears on a dime and he puts it to great use, running the audience through a gamut of emotions—pinballing from laughter to fright—in this hugely entertaining crowd-pleaser.\n\nRegular Fantastic Fest attendees will know that the festival normally will not play any films that have previously played in Texas, and definitely not ones which have played in Austin.

When a doctor informs her that she’s too old to carry a baby, Maria’s world disintegrates. Refusing to accept her fate, she sets out on a journey that will see her cross paths with a junkie and some very dangerous people, and lead her to an end she never would have expected.\n\nMarking the comeback of Kim Bassinger, I AM HERE is provocative filmmaking from the man who shook our world with PRINCESS in 2007. Taking the same no-holds-barred approach as that visceral film, Morgenthaler challenges the audience’s perceptions of vulnerability, power and emotional disturbance by exploring the soul of a very damaged character who still may manage to achieve her dreams. Uncompromising to the highest degree, he populates the world with losers, con-men and violent criminals whose nihilism correlates perfectly with the dead-eyed quest of our lead. Add to this some fantasy sequences which may or may not be the result of a delusional mind, and you have a highly volatile mix which is sure to spark the imagination of any audience member. The fact that Morgenthaler remains impassive and non-judgemental in the face of all that occurs only heightens the tension and the involvement of the audicence.\n\nQuiet but brutal, I AM HERE features incredible performances from Kim Basinger, Peter Stormare and Jordan Prentice, and will be a hot topic of discussion for anyone who sees it.

Their lives are thrown into radical disarray when dad finishes his time and returns to the family home.

Celebrate the release of Spectacular Optical’s debut anthology Kid Power with an offbeat slapstick gangster musical that features ruthless mobsters, gin hall singers and hard-nosed cops… played exclusively by a cast of children. Alan Parker’s BUGSY MALONE showcases the talents of a pre-Chachi Scott Baio and 13-year-old Jodie Foster in perhaps the most elaborate playground game of cops and robbers ever attempted. In the film, Baio, playing the titular role, gets mixed up with one of the pint-sized gangs competing to take over the “sarsaparilla racket” by uncovering a cache of the ultimate weapon: tommy-gun like “splurge guns” that—instead of spraying bullets—shoot forth globs of custard that take their recipient out of commission. But what starts as a novelty soon gives way to a genuinely interesting story, supported ably by the pre-teen cast and a sprinkling of Broadway-style song and dance numbers written (and sometimes performed) by Paul Williams. Goofing on the clichés of prohibition-era set gangster pics like THE STING, DILLINGER and Robert Altman’s THIEVES LIKE US, the film plays off of the absurdity of miniature mobsters talking up dancers at speakeasies and chasing each other in Model T pedal cars. More importantly, BUGSY MALONE also exemplifies the idea of kid power, as the film’s small stars get the chance to resolve their own issues in a world without parents or adult authority—especially once the story explodes in delicious, creamy warfare.

      "long_description": "Richard Stanley emerged in the early ‘90s as one of the world’s hottest genre directors. His first two films—HARDWARE and DUST DEVIL—are rightly considered to be classics. Stanley’s third film was a highly anticipated adaptation of H.G. Wells’ THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU starring Marlon Brando and Val Kilmer. Early in the film's production, news of dissent and production troubles began to filter out from the set in Cairns, Australia. Ultimately, executives at New Line Films fired Stanley on the first day of shooting. Legendary director John Frankenheimer was brought in to “save” the production, but his efforts proved to be fruitless: THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU is still regarded as a major disaster.\n\nIn LOST SOUL - THE DOOMED JOURNEY OF RICHARD STANLEY’S ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU, director David Gregory sorts through decades of rumors and myth to reveal the true behind-the-scenes story of the film’s troubled history. Many of the key players in the production, including Stanley, Robert Shaye, Edward R. Pressman, Fairuza Balk and members of Stan Winston's effects team, present their sides of the story. The interviews reveal that the film was plagued by production mishaps, warring egos, and numerous other problems, both large and small. LOST SOUL is a treasure trove of fascinating stories ranging from Marlon Brando's bizarre erratic behavior to Val Kilmer's ego-driven sabotage to Richard Stanley's covert ops after being kicked off the set. This documentary truly must be seen to be believed. (Rodney Perkins)",

From Tom Hardy's career-defining titular Bronson to Mads Mikkelsen's feral One Eye to Ryan Gosling's icy cold Driver, Refn has time and again crafted nuanced portraits of deeply conflicted but undeniably charismatic antiheroes.\n\nIn MY LIFE DIRECTED BY NICOLAS WINDING REFN, Refn's own deep conflict is swinging in the breeze as we witness him wrestle with the particularly challenging production of ONLY GOD FORGIVES. Directed and shot by his wife Liv Corfixen over the duration of the production and subsequent Cannes debut, MY LIFE DIRECTED BY NICOLAS WINDING REFN captures the very private and intimate moments to which a traditional documentary crew simply wouldn't have access. The result is a fascinating, detailed look at a creative genius at work and also a portrait of a director torn between the general public's desire for a \"DRIVE 2\" and his own mission to explore more challenging narrative territory. Acclaimed composer and regular Refn collaborator Cliff Martinez composed the doc's original score. Director Liv Corfixen and her subject/husband will be on hand following the screening for a spirited Q&A. (Tim League)",

While at Tomas’ funeral, Dante is overwhelmed with fear and comes to believe that someone is following him. Soon, people close to Dante begin to die in gruesome ways. Dante must overcome his necrophobia to solve the mystery that threatens his life and the lives of those around him.\n\nNECROPHOBIA 3D is the latest work from Argentinian director Daniel de La Vega (JENNIFER’S SHADOW). Here, de La Vega has created a thriller directly influenced by Italian giallo, particularly Dario Argento. Unlike a number of recent giallo-inspired films, NECROPHOBIA eschews surrealism and psychedelia in favor of a more formal approach that emphasizes story and suspense. All of the classic giallo signifiers are in place, including a labyrinthine plot, a paranoiac protagonist, a blade-wielding killer dressed in a black topcoat, and a lurid visual scheme full of bright saturated colors.\n\nNECROPHOBIA takes everything a step further. Instead of using music from other films or that mimics previous styles, de La Vega commissioned Claudio Simonetti—founder of the musical group Goblin (composers of music for films such as DEEP RED and SUSPIRIA)—to create an entirely new original score. Restrained use of 3D enhances the film's atmosphere. NECROPHOBIA brings together these elements into create a satisfyingly sinister homage to classic Italian horror. (Rodney Perkins)",

It's little wonder the Chinese censors balked at Ning's too-honest portrayal and it went unreleased for four long years.\n\nLeaving his cushy job in the city to defend a falcon poacher accused of murdering a cop, lawyer Pan Xiao (Xu Zheng) soon finds himself marooned in a dustbowl wilderness. Faced with trouble-making truck drivers, swindling rest stop owners, petty cops, a sultry prostitute and even the poacher's backstabbing accomplice (CRAZY RACER star Huang Bo), Pan is soon fighting for his life on an absurd odyssey through the Chinese outback.\n\nNing Hao's unforgiving depiction of life in mainland China plays out like a Coen Brothers reimagining of Jia Xiangke's A TOUCH OF SIN, painting a world in which only the ruthless survive, where law enforcement is impotent, money talks and human life is held in staggeringly low regard. So basically, the new economic behemoth that is China today, in all its no-frills glory. Ning assembles a fine cast of long-term collaborators who bring a fantastic energy and comedic sensibility to the otherwise brutal subject matter, while the desert vistas are shot in almost Fordian reverence, reminding us time and again how barren and devoid of morality the country has become.(James Marsh)",

Seligman listens intently to her litany of perversions. While doing so, he asks questions and explores the larger implications of her deeds. He relates her stories to such divergent topics as music, art, mathematics, philosophy and fly fishing. Yes, fly fishing. The various themes and patterns eventually converge with devastating impact.

She's raised her younger sister on her own, a task complicated by her extreme agoraphobia. Montse never leaves the apartment, but works as a seamstress for clients that come to her. Combined with her sister's work at a local store, they just manage to squeak out a living. But the girl is curious and she has questions about their past that Montse can't or won't answer.\r\n\r\nAll Montse will say about their mother is that she died giving birth to the girl. That answer has never been satisfying, and the girl envies Montse because she has pictures with their mother. And then there's their father who just disappeared one day during the war. Maybe he left to fight, or maybe the death of his wife was too much for him, or maybe there's something else... something more sinister behind his disappearance.\r\n\r\nMontse's agoraphobia is tested when their upstairs neighbor falls down the stairs and lands just outside their front door. Montse decides to help him, bringing him into the apartment and propping him up in bed. But it quickly becomes apparent that Montse has an agenda of her own, and while it may endanger everyone involved, the girl may just get the answers to the questions she's had for so long.\r\n\r\nProduced by Fantastic Fest alum Alex de la Iglesia, SHREW’S NEST explores the different types of fears that plague us all.

The bar owner fires Evan, leaving him with few options (and the possibility of legal action from the asshole he beat up). Evan makes a spur of the moment decision to fly to Italy to get away from his problems.\n\nOnce in Italy, Evan makes fast friends with Tom and Sam, two boisterous Brits seemingly on a mission to drink all the beer in Italy. The three rent a car and head down the coast to a small tourist town on the water. While drinking with the boys, he sees a beautiful woman, but his attempts to get a date with her fail. When the Brits leave for Amsterdam, Evan stays behind and finds a room in exchange for work with an old farmer. He runs into the stunning woman again and manages to get himself a date, and then another, but it soon becomes clear that she has dark secrets that may destroy them both.\n\nCo-directors Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead burst onto the indie horror scene in 2012 with their fantastic debut feature RESOLUTION.

An ambitious journalist named Jazmin (Luz Cipriot) is looking for an opportunity to advance her career. While investigating Julia’s murder, she finds that all of the murders share something in common: the victims are all tied to the local beef industry. Numerous suspects arise, including a radical environmental group that’s been papering the town with pamphlets. As Jazmin’s investigation deepens and she gets closer to a solution, she inevitably enters the killer’s path.\n\nIn 2013, STILL LIFE deservedly won the main prize in the work-in-progress section of Ventana Sur’s genre film market, Blood Window. Now, Fantastic Fest presents the film in its completed bloody form. Set against the backdrop of Argentina’s tradition of cattle ranching and beef production, STILL LIFE is a slasher film with a strong dose of social commentary. Here, first-time feature director Gabriel Grieco gives the audience a serial killer whose motive is to avenge all animals that have been mistreated by humans. Although STILL LIFE carries a message, it is first and foremost a horror movie—a very blunt and direct horror movie. Like a hammer to the head, STILL LIFE hits hard. (Rodney Perkins)",

It was a brutal crime that pointed to students at a nearby boarding school for the extreme upper crust until an outsider stepped forward to confess and the whole thing was just swept away. Twenty years also since Kimmie, a young woman who left a frantic message to the police about the crime, also disappeared. It’s too unlikely to be a coincidence, and when the case file crosses the desk of detective Carl Morck (the fabulous Nikolaj Lie Kaas), it plunges him into a decades-old cover-up and into direct conflict with the powerful elite.\r\n\r\nIt was back in 2010 that director Mikkel Norgaard launched an all out assault on the Danish box office with outrageous comedy KLOWN—the film that proved a monstrous hit here at Fantastic Fest while breaking stacks of box office records in its home country. In the aftermath of KLOWN, the safe thing for Norgaard to do would be to stick with comedy, but instead he took a hard left turn into the world of crime literature with THE KEEPER OF LOST CAUSES—the first of Jussi Adler Olsen’s hugely popular Department Q series of cold case crime novels—and set the box office on fire again. This time he followed up with the “safe” thing and moved on to book two for his next project.\r\n\r\nYet another high point in what seems to be a neverending string of high quality crime offerings out of Scandinavia, the Department Q novels have won a loyal following around the globe amongst fans of Jo Nesbo and Steig Larsson for the simple reason that they’re very, very good; loaded with complex characters and compelling mysteries while Norgaard and his cast have proven a perfect match to the source material.

Sam’s behavioral problems cause issues with friends and family, leading Amelia to lose more and more sleep. Drifting through a hazy life fighting off grief, guilt and her own flesh and blood, Amelia’s motherly instincts are nearly shredded before one night’s bedtime story comes in the form of a mysterious and gruesomely detailed pop-up book called “Mr. Babadook.” Adding to his already violent outbursts is a new obsessive fear of the titular Babadook, and Sam comes dangerously close to pushing his mother to her breaking point before a knock-knock-knock at the door means the pair might have something more sinister to battle than each other.\n\nExpanding her short film MONSTER into her debut feature, Jennifer Kent explodes onto the horror scene with a film that oozes confidence. Her script and direction, the wickedly clever editing, the brilliant production and sound design and, not least of all, the two pitch-perfect central performances by Davis and Wiseman combine to deliver a horror experience nobody will soon forget. This twisted fairy tale never takes the easy way out, cheap shocks are not substituted for carefully built atmosphere, no tension is weakened by unnecessary comic relief and the special effects are a wonderful mix of old school techniques. It also never forgets the human drama at its very core.\n\nTHE BABADOOK is incredibly effective because it puts its audience in a truly gripping emotional stronghold. That... and it’s scary as shit.

Sharp and Grabham take a sort of Errol Morris approach to their subjects – scientists, artists and amateur enthusiasts – leaving them free to wax poetic about their most unusual obsession leading the viewer to conclude that perhaps some of the humans around us are every bit as alien as the things that grow unseen in the dark and perhaps the world is a better – or at least more interesting – place because of it.(Todd Brown)",

The soundtrack is a glorious, over-the-top accomplishment which serves to highlight the action like no other.\n\nLet us also not forget the gross, brilliant murder sequences which comprise the backbone of any giallo; long, drawn-out affairs always predisposed towards the ridiculous.

When they attempt to exit, they find that the staircase has turned into an infinitely repeating corridor from which they cannot escape. During the same time frame, a family leaves home for a vacation. They travel down a familiar road towards their destination. As time passes, the stretch of road and the surrounding desert begin to repeat. Like their counterparts in the stairwell, they are also stuck in a loop.\n\nIn 2013, Isaac Ezban pitched THE INCIDENT at the inaugural edition of Fantastic Market/Mercado Fantastico. The jury awarded the project with Best Presentation. The completed film premiered at the 2014 edition of Marché du Film as part of a special week of screenings organized by Blood Window at Ventana Sur. Now, Fantastic Fest is proud to present the film’s North American premiere.\n\nTHE INCIDENT is a surrealistic sci-fi vision that uses the idea of infinite loops to explore both the frailty of human life and broader metaphysical concepts. Ezban’s influences, which range from Philip K. Dick to Rod Serling, are readily apparent, but there is a very original vision at work here. Repetition is a key component of the film with the two stories taking place over a decades-long time span. The characters spend the rest of their lives trapped in loops. While elements of their environments constantly regenerate, none of them escape the reality of aging and death. THE INCIDENT is an ambitious, puzzle-like film from a rising new talent.

He and his wife (Anta Aizupe) plan to escape the stress by taking an Italian vacation. On the evening before the trip, one of the fired workers (Maxim Lazarev) slips into their home. He is identified by part of his uniform: an orange safety jacket. Although his immediate actions reveal a murderous intent, revenge is only the initial step.\n\nThis feature-length debut from Latvian director Aik Karapetian is a fresh and wholly unique horror film that deals with themes of revenge, class struggle and madness. Once the antagonist exacts revenge, he embraces the lifestyle of his victims. He takes over their house. He wears their clothes. He eats at the same restaurants. However, wallowing in wealth and decadent acts only provides a temporary respite from the stark reality of his crimes.\n\nWorking as both social commentary and as a REPULSION-style character study, MAN IN THE ORANGE JACKET lays an unblinking eye on the aftermath of its lead anti-hero and, within his very routine, tries to find the origins of his madness. Deliberately paced and tinged with moments of exquisite violence, MAN IN THE ORANGE JACKET offers the audience a trip into a history and place they were never aware of, much like the recent Latvian sci-fi VANISHING WAVES. An impressive, frightening journey into the heart of madness that also takes in concepts as varied as financial crisis, social status and the state of the individual. Like a Latvian HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER, this is stark, brutal and unexpected cinema at its most raw. (Rodney Perkins)",

In 2012, Fantastic Fest showcased the US premiere of Roth collaborator Nicolás López earthquake thriller AFTERSHOCK, and this year will feature Guillermo Amoedo’s English language debut THE STRANGER. López and Amoedo worked with Roth on 2013 FF favorite THE GREEN INFERNO as well as his upcoming KNOCK KNOCK.\n\nAmoedo shows a deft ability to turn a bloodthirsty monster movie on its head, into a slow-burn, character-driven film. THE STRANGER takes its time, building the tension through occasional flashbacks and having the audience sympathize with Peter, who grew up not knowing his father. Peter, like the audience, is kept largely in the dark about his father's motives or even what he is... because he’s certainly not human. What is apparent is the chaos his dad's return has on the small town, especially a member of the police force and his violence-prone son.\n\nTHE STRANGER is ultimately about family, the legacy we pass on to our children and the lengths we go to protect and ensure their survival, no matter how dark and deadly they might become.

He moves his family into an extravagant palace and has his daughter trained in all manners of royalty. As suitors from across the land come to win her hand, the newly-named Kaguya longs for her simpler days in the forest, and does everything she can to change her fate.\n\nBased on ancient Japanese folklore, THE TALE OF PRINCESS KAGUYA is Studio Ghibli co-founder Isao Takahata’s first film since MY NEIGHBORS THE YAMADAS in 1999. It’s been well worth the wait. The brush painting-inspired animation is breathtaking and the surreal look perfectly complements the fantasy elements. At its core, the film is a feminist tale as Princess Kaguya fights to make her own choices and not succumb to the pressures of her parents, society and Earth as a whole. It’s thoroughly striking in story and craftsmanship and, simply put, THE TALES OF PRINCESS KAGUYA is utterly fantastic.(Brian Kelley)",

It jumps to present day, at a drive-in movie theater on a cool fall night in October, where the locals are watching a screening of the 1976 film. Local high school girl Jami is lonely and a bit shy despite her girl-next-door good looks, so when a boy finally asks her on a date to see the movie, she jumps at the chance. But the film upsets her, and she asks if they can leave. They pull into a small clearing in the woods to make out and are attacked by an assailant wearing a cloth mask, just like the phantom killer from the film. Jami escapes and goes directly to the police, but the killings continue and the police have no leads. Jami's interest in the case overwhelms her and she starts researching the original killings on her own. With the police stumped, Jami may be the only one who can find the truth and put an end to the bloodshed.\r\n\r\nThis new film from indie horror producer Jason Blum stars familiar faces like Gary Cole, Ed Lauter and Edward Herrmann. It follows the original film closely while simultaneously acknowledging its existence and trying to put a new spin on things.

Though police believed they had the culprit in a known local sex offender they were never able to prove anything conclusively, and Cafmeyer has had to live with the culprit nearby for the rest of his life. And so, decades later, when a nine-year-old child goes missing, it should come as no surprise that Cafmeyer’s determination to crack the case borders on obsessive, with his gaze locked firm on the suspect in his own brother’s disappearance.\r\n\r\nAdapted from the novel of the same name by Mo Hayder, Hans Herbots’ THE TREATMENT proved a huge hit at the Belgian box office, demonstrating that the wave of high end crime thrillers currently sweeping Europe is not at all confined to Scandinavia. Much like the recent wave of Nordic Noir, THE TREATMENT is driven by complex characters and a pitch black heart. The stakes are high and personal, the cost of failure extreme, the human capacity for evil equally so. Blessed with strong performances from top to bottom and a firm directorial hand in the experienced Herbots—a veteran of both film and high end television—THE TREATMENT is the sort of filmmaking that thrived on American screens throughout the ‘70s, but now has been driven away by exhibitors and studios more interested in drawing teenage dollars than catering to more complex tastes.

If you consider yourself a fan of film, you simply must see it. There’s nothing else like this.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy? Because the dialogue is entirely done in sign language with no translation or subtitles. And it’s fucking amazing. Imagine feeling a movie for two plus hours. That’s what THE TRIBE asks its audience to do and it’s a profound and deeply moving experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt its heart, THE TRIBE is a love story between newly transferred Sergey and fellow student Anna. Their school is basically a front for corrupt teachers who recruit their students to engage in theft and prostitution. Sergey quickly get drawn into the life of crime, and as he works his way up the rigid hierarchy, he starts pimping out female students. One is Anna, who isn’t just a prostitute, but a concubine for the school’s top criminals. Sergey is given a night with Anna as a reward and they fall for each other. That’s a violation of the gang’s rigid code and the two quickly find their lives in mortal danger.\r\n\r\n\r\nDirector Myroslav Slaboshpytskiy was attempting to create a pure cinematic expression that reminded one of the silent film days, and his debut feature succeeds so well that it’s impossible to dismiss it as a gimmick. The film succeeds not just because of the lack of subtitles, but because seemingly every element here is exceptional, from the composition and photography to the production design to the incredibly brave acting, especially by female lead Yana Novikova. Her performance is spirited, passionate and raw. At Cannes, she was given a standing ovation. As she rose to acknowledge the applause, one became aware she couldn’t hear the accolades, but she could feel it and was overwhelmed with emotion. It’s the same sensation you’ll feel while watching this movie. (James Shapiro)",

He sees an opportunity to quickly restore himself as the man of the house and sets off on a mission to find her.

Tommy himself is mysteriously not to be found.\n\nA very different sort of crime film, METROPIA director Tarik Saleh returns to Fantastic Fest with TOMMY. It’s not just the story of the woman behind the man, but of the women—three generations in all—and each of them determined to get what’s theirs by any means necessary.\n\nWhere most gangster films end with the job in question (whether it goes right or wrong), Saleh instead unravels his web long after the fact. The actual job is now long past, with the players involved firmly entrenched in their deceits while those around them struggle to cope with the consequences and carve out a livable space for themselves. Saleh ratchets up the tension, not so much with fire power as with the threat of raw brutality and divided loyalties where nobody—not even family—can truly be trusted. Because this is a world where everyone is ultimately out for themselves and betrayal is de rigeur.\n\nA sterling example of the current wave of Nordic crime noir’s ability to satisfy genre conventions while simultaneously confounding them, TOMMY is a surprising turn in a new direction from a man who was already one of Sweden’s most intriguing directors.

      "long_description": "In an isolated town on the west coast of Denmark lives 16-year-old Marie, with her almost-catatonic mother and her nervous, caring father. At first glance, Marie’s life is familiar: growing pains, a new job, and a fledgling romance all point to the world of a typical teenager. However, under the surface lies a secret so dark that it threatens to upset the existence of her family and the entire town.\n\nFrom director Jonas Alexander Arnby comes the most unusual coming-of-age story of the year. Part LET THE RIGHT ONE IN and part tone poem, WHEN ANIMALS DREAM is a haunting elegy to growing up and independence. Resolutely unique and powerfully quiet, the film is blessed with standout performances from Sonia Suhl, Sonja Richter and genre favorite Lars Mikkelsen, as well as a beautiful and unforgettable soundtrack. Using the isolation of its setting to his advantage, director Arnby creates an eerie atmosphere tense with judgement and paranoia. Like a reverse exploration of the original Universal monster, the villagers within this sparse settlement serve as judgemental obstacles as opposed to wide-eyed and innocent keepers of a dark secret.\n\nWith two strong female leads at hand, Arnby explores sexuality and coming-of-age in a universal language. It’s not just the small-town mentality of the population which keep the women ensnared; it’s also the acceptance of their own body and being which may lead to more trouble than they could ever expect. Eschewing violence in favor of confrontational reality, Arnby still creates a fearless film which can be as visceral as any before it.\n\nDefying the in-your-face tactics of usual genre fare in favor of understated brilliance, this film leaves a mark that will be impossible to forget.

      "long_description": "Martin (Vincent Redetzki) is a law student in Berlin. He’s excited to finally move away from home, but apartments are scarce. Eventually, he finds a cheap crummy apartment after the previous tenant disappears. While cleaning the messy flat, Martin discovers secret passageways that run adjacent to the home of his mysterious landlord Simone (Katharina Heyer). During his free time, Martin listens as Simone and her boyfriend (Florian Panzner) argue and have sex. When Martin finally meets Simone, he is quickly drawn into her bizarre and dangerous life.\n\nThe first feature from Grzegorz Muskala is a dark thriller that’s equal parts Lynch and Polanski. A choking claustrophobic atmosphere pervades the entire film, as most of the events take place within Martin and Simone’s apartments. Although stylish and visually clever, characters and relationships are the key to the film’s success. Martin is a naif who is eager to explore life outside of his parent's home. Blinded by his newfound sense of personal and sexual freedom, he fails to notice the dangers that lie in front of him. Simone is alluring and methodical. Her damaged psychology is apparent but she’s also shown to be emotionally sensitive and vulnerable. Alternately funny and depraved, WHISPERS BEHIND THE WALL is a dark dizzying exploration of a strange—and ultimately doomed—relationship. (Rodney Perkins)",

      "long_description": "“This morning I shot my wife and child with a nail gun,” mutters the emotionally spent Barry in his first moment on camera. “I don’t know how to make a story of that.” Well, Barry may not know how to make that into a story, but Australian brother duo Kiah and Tristan Roache-Turner—writer-director and writer-producer of Australian effort WYRMWOOD, respectively—sure as fuck do. And what this brother act deliver is one of the most balls-out and fabulously entertaining entries into the zombie canon in years.\r\n\r\nWhen falling stars bring a mysterious plague onto the land, transforming all but a select few into ravenous, bloodthirsty monsters, gruff-but-kind family man Barry is left with no family but his sister Brooke stranded hours away, with hundreds of the ravenous beasts between them. But with nothing left to live for except his sister, Barry’s not going to let anything stand in his way; not the undead and certainly not the military forces who may be even more dangerous than the creatures they’re supposedly protecting people from.\r\n\r\nBy adding intriguing new elements to the zombie mythos, along with a heaping dose of MAD MAX-inspired vehicular modification and an enormous serving of pure, raw talent, the Roache-Turner Brothers deliver one cracking piece of entertainment loaded with scares, gore and off-kilter comedy for one of the most auspicious debuts since… well, since a certain other Australian brother act appeared on the scene with UNDEAD. Yes, they really are that good. (Todd Brown)",

      "long_description": "FUTURE SHOCK! tells the story of 2000AD: a UK science-fiction comic that came to change the face of the comics industry. First published in 1977 to cash in on the success of STAR WARS, 2000AD proved wildly popular with readers, but quickly forged its own distinct identity, light years away from the clear-cut heroes and villains of George Lucas' space operatics. The comic was violent, edgy, anti-authoritarian, blackly funny and above all, idiosyncratically British. Not only did it introduce seminal creators such as Alan Moore and Grant Morrison, it also had a profound influence on pop culture at large, with such cult cinema hits as ROBOCOP and HARDWARE paying overt homage to it soon after its initial publication.\r\n\r\nThe comprehensive documentary account of how the comic came to be, how it survived for 36 years, and how it continues to be an innovator and game-changer, FUTURE SHOCK! offers an illuminating overview of the magazine's history: a warts and all look at the various highs and lows, a peek inside the creative process of some of its most notable creators, and a funny, moving and passionate chronicle of how a disparate band of talented eccentrics came together to create something both visionary and extraordinary.\r\n\r\nFeaturing interviews with legendary fan-favourites such as Neil Gaiman and Grant Morrison, plus dynamic visual sequences that pay tribute to the groundbreaking artwork published in the comic throughout the years, this is the exhaustive final word on 2000AD. The scrappy upstart that is all too often overlooked amongst the constant waves of Marvel/DC corporate hype, 2000AD is more vital than either of them – independent, cutting edge and still punk after all these years. FUTURE SHOCK! aims to finally give the comic its due.",
