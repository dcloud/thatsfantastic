    "description": "From Masaaki Yuasa, director of the wonderful THE NIGHT IS SHORT, WALK ON GIRL and MIND GAME, comes a deeply effective anime that is both a love letter to the sea and a moving rumination on the nature of loss.\n\nHinako is a college student whose main passion is surfing. Shortly after she moves into her new apartment, an accident causes the place to catch fire and brings handsome firefighter Minato into her life. Soon the two are inseparable and slowly start to fall in love. However, a tragic accident will force the newfound lovers apart, and the two will have to explore very different paths to potentially find each other again.\n\nJust like Yuasa's previous work, RIDE YOUR WAVE is filled to the brim with interesting characters, stellar style, and a sense for the story that never falters or takes a false step. Exploring love and loss entwined within the same moment, the film is both melancholic and charming, an amazing piece of heartfelt storytelling that resonates without ever being mawkish.\n\nThough he never loses his unique sense of the weird, Yuasa manages to create one of his most accessible works in RIDE YOUR WAVE. With its incredible color palette and drawing style, it's an exceptional blend of the emotional and the supernatural that pops off the screen. (EVRIM ERSOY)",
