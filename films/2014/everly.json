A call girl by trade, Everly has turned against her gangster boss Taiko (Hiroyuki Watanabe) and become a police informant. In response, Taiko has put out a hit on Everly and her family. Soon, every criminal in town wants to cash in. Everly\u2019s survival instincts quickly kick in as she matches wits and firepower with Taiko and a seemingly endless stream of killers.\n\n\tJoe Lynch is best known as the director of films such as WRONG TURN 2 and KNIGHTS OF BADASSDOM. With EVERLY, Lynch\u2014working from a screenplay by Yale Hannon\u2014sets off in a very different direction from his prior works. Displaying a diverse array of influences\u2014particularly the cinema of Takashi Miike\u2014he delivers a stylish pulpy action film with a massive body count and a whole lot of black humor. EVERLY mostly takes place within the confines of the titular character\u2019s apartment but the film never seems constrained by physical space. Instead, it unfolds at a relentless pace as Lynch unleashes surprise after violent surprise upon the viewer.\n\n\tSalma Hayek dominates the screen with an intense physical performance that makes one wonder why she isn\u2019t cast as a lead in more action movies. In addition to meeting the physical demands of the role, Hayek brings serious pathos and sympathy to the film\u2019s heroine. EVERLY is a furious dose of fist-pumping action that will leave the audience cheering. (Rodney Perkins)",
