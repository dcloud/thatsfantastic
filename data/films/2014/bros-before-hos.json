    "description": "Max (Tim Haars) and Jules (DaniÃ«l Arends) are brothers from different mothers. Max and Jules make a promise to each other at a young age: never let a woman split them apart. Over time, the brothers grow from naive kids to irresponsible adults. Jules manages a grocery store while Max works in a video store. When they aren't working, the pair revel in endless nights of drunken hook-ups and sexist games. One fateful day, Max meets Anna (Sylvia Hoecks), the woman of his dreams. Jules quickly hooks up with her, which sparks a war between the brothers over the affection of this special woman.",
