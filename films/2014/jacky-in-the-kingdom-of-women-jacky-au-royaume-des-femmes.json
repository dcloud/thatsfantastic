In this fictional military dictatorship, women are in power. They give the orders and they fight the wars. On the other hand, the Bubunne men don\u2019t really do anything besides housework. They are forced to wear veils and are led around like dogs. The dream of all young Bubunne men is to marry the Colonelee (Charlotte Gainsbourg), who is the daughter of the country\u2019s military leader (An\u00e9mone). Like every other young man, Jacky (Vincent Lacoste) spends his days dreaming of being the Colonelee's husband. Unexpected events interfere with Jacky\u2019s plans of domestic bliss and threaten to topple the Bubunne matriarchy.\n\n\tJACKY IN THE KINGDOM OF WOMEN is a scathing dystopian satire with a perverse and very sharp sense of humor. Instead of simply riffing on gender roles, writer-director Riad Sattouf (LES BEAUX GOSSES) takes aim at various forms of religious intolerance and political hypocrisy. Some of the analogies are subtle. Others are rather blunt. The direction and art design are spectacular. The cast, which includes Gainsbourg, Val\u00e9rie Bonneton, and Michel Hazanavicius, is uniformly excellent. JACKY IN THE KINGDOM OF WOMEN is a thought-provoking, intelligent, and endlessly entertaining film. (Rodney Perkins)",
