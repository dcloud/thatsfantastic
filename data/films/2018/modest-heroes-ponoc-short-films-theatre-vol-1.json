    "description": "Founded by Yoshiaki Nishimura after the closure of Studio Ghibli and formed by some of the same creative staff, Studio Ponoc's first film, MARY AND THE WITCH'S FLOWER, was a breakthrough hit that laid a serious foundation. The studio's second effort — an anthology of short films titled MODEST HEROES: PONOC SHORT FILMS THEATRE, VOL. 1 — is a testament to the vision and imagination of its creators.\n\nIn KANINI & KANINO, a pair of crab siblings are separated from their father and find themselves on a grand quest to find him. LIFE AIN'T GONNA LOSE focuses on a boy whose severe allergy to eggs means everyday life is incredibly difficult for him. Lastly, INVISIBLE closes the trilogy with a story of an invisible man, exploring exactly how an average day in his life might feel.\n\nUniting the stories is the same heart and soul that has enchanted us over the years, and the unique animation style of each segment keeps the films distinct from each other. A promise of what's to come from this brilliant studio, MODEST HEROES: PONOC SHORT FILMS THEATRE, VOL. 1 is both an incredible introduction as well as a love letter to an art form that has the power to take us places we never imagined we could visit.
