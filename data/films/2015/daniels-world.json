    "description": "As a society, we are more understanding and accepting these days than ever before about the nature of our sexual urges. We have grown far more tolerant to those whose sexual identity was until recently thought by many to be deviant behavior. Because of this increased enlightenment, now is the best time to see and be challenged by a film like DANIEL'S WORLD. Daniel is 25 years old, lives in the Czech Republic, wants to be a writer, has never dated, and is in love with an eight-year old boy. This is his identity and it's among the most challenging ways to be defined in any culture. But that is Daniel's day to day reality and he wants his sexual identity be accepted by society. He has never acted on his desires and repeatedly insists he never will.",
