    "description": "In the opening scene, Ig (Radcliffe) foreshadows, \"When you go through Hell, the only way out is to walk deeper through the fire.\" Since he's been unanimously accused of raping and murdering his longtime girlfriend Marren (Juno Temple, seemingly named from the EXORCIST priest), Ig can only wonder how much deeper into the fire he can go. He wakes up one morning with horns growing from his head and strange new powers, including the ability to have anyone tell them their darkest truths (\"I've never been with a jigaboo before,\" a neighbor says). Ig also has the skill to make them act on these desires. He's initially appalled by this development, but the opportunity to use these powers to find out the truth in Marren's death is a dance with the devil that's too good to pass up.",
