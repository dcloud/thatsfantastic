    "description": "From alumnus director Marc Meyers and writer Alan Trezza comes a heavy metal midnight film that doesn't skimp on the thrills while also presenting well-written and interesting characters, concocting a one-of-a-kind experience.\n\nVal, Beverly, and Alexis are best friends headed on a road trip to attend a heavy metal music festival. An incident on the road has the girls confronting Mark, Kovacs, and Ivan in the parking lot, but any tension dissolves quickly and the group gets on swimmingly. A suggestion to have a post-concert after-party sees the rag-tag group head to Alexis' secluded country home. Meanwhile, the heartland of America has been rocked by a series of Satanic murders, and it's not long before these two threads cross, resulting in a night from which no one will escape unscathed.\n\nOne part HEAVY METAL PARKING LOT, one part SATANIC PANIC, and all entertainment, WE SUMMON THE DARKNESS is a joyride from the first frame until the last. Both sets of characters are well-drawn and interesting, and there's a wealth of standout horror sequences once things start to go wrong. Add to the mix an unusual turn from Johnny Knoxville and you may have just the perfect package.\n\nLoud, brash, fun, and incredibly well-written, WE SUMMON THE DARKNESS is a testament to the talent behind it: a throwback late-night movie that is guaranteed to blow you away.
