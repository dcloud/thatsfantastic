    "synopsis": "An epic suburban fever dream about a boy, a babysitter and prescription LSD. LA fringe filmmaker Vincent De Ghoulie claims to have invoked the spirit of his former teacher and great experimental artist George Kuchar while making the film and the result is something so magnificently singular it deserves to sits alongside cinematic company as prestigious as Lynch's INLAND EMPIRE and as infamous as Breen's FATEFUL FINDINGS. May melt your brain, but will split your sides and leave you in utter astonishment.",
