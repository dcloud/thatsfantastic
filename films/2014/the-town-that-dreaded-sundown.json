    "raw_body": "Brief Summary\n\n\tYears after a series of grisly murders rocked Texarkana, someone has started recreating the killings. A young girl who got away may be the town's only shot at finding the killer.\n\nFull Description\n\n\tThis remake of the \u201870s underdog horror hit kicks off by summarizing the actual killings that took place in the 1940s on the Texas-Arkansas border. It jumps to present day, at a drive-in movie theater on a cool fall night in October, where the locals are watching a screening of the 1976 film. Local high school girl Jami is lonely and a bit shy despite her girl-next-door good looks, so when a boy finally asks her on a date to see the movie, she jumps at the chance. But the film upsets her, and she asks if they can leave. They pull into a small clearing in the woods to make out and are attacked by an assailant wearing a cloth mask, just like the phantom killer from the film. Jami escapes and goes directly to the police, but the killings continue and the police have no leads. Jami's interest in the case overwhelms her and she starts researching the original killings on her own. With the police stumped, Jami may be the only one who can find the truth and put an end to the bloodshed.\n\n\tThis new film from indie horror producer Jason Blum stars familiar faces like Gary Cole, Ed Lauter and Edward Herrmann. It follows the original film closely while simultaneously acknowledging its existence and trying to put a new spin on things. THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN is a stylish meta remake that's innovatively and intelligently self-aware. (Luke Mullen)"
