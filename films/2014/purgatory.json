    "raw_body": "Brief Summary\n\n\tA\u00a0 woman must survive the night after she welcomes a neighbor's child into her home.\n\nFull Description\n\n\tMarta (Oona Chaplin) and Luis (Andres Gertrudix) move into a new apartment after the death of their child. Luis is called away on business, thus leaving Marta to spend the night in the apartment alone. Marta\u2019s evening is interrupted when a neighbor knocks on her door. The neighbor\u2019s husband has been in an accident. She wants to leave her young son Daniel (Sergi M\u00e9ndez). Marta accepts the boy into her home, and quickly finds out that something is very wrong with the child.\n\n\tPURGATORY finds first-time director Pau Teixidor and writer Sergio G. S\u00e1nchez (THE ORPHANAGE) teamed up with the same production team behind films such as THE IMPOSSIBLE, INTRUDERS and OPEN WINDOWS. The result is a subtle and disturbing supernatural thriller that\u2019s familiar yet fresh. A combination of naturalistic performances and Teixidor\u2019s elegantly restrained direction create a sense of intimacy and gravitas that is often absent from such films. Oona Chaplin, who perhaps best known for a recurring role on GAME OF THRONES, delivers a powerful performance as a woman who is terrorized by supernatural forces. Sergi M\u00e9ndez is perfect as a creepy, evil kid who will just not go away.\n\n\tPURGATORY is a potent work that falls squarely within the great tradition of fantastical Spanish cinema as reflected in works such as THE ORPHANAGE and THE OTHERS.
