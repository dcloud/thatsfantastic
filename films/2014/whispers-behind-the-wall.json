He\u2019s excited to finally move away from home, but apartments are scarce. Eventually, he finds a cheap crummy apartment after the previous tenant disappears. While cleaning the messy flat, Martin discovers secret passageways that run adjacent to the home of his mysterious landlord Simone (Katharina Heyer). During his free time, Martin listens as Simone and her boyfriend (Florian Panzner) argue and have sex. When Martin finally meets Simone, he is quickly drawn into her bizarre and dangerous life.\n\n\tThe first feature from Grzegorz Muskala is a dark thriller that\u2019s equal parts Lynch and Polanski. A choking claustrophobic atmosphere pervades the entire film, as most of the events take place within Martin and Simone\u2019s apartments. Although stylish and visually clever, characters and relationships are the key to the film\u2019s success. Martin is a naif who is eager to explore life outside of his parent's home. Blinded by his newfound sense of personal and sexual freedom, he fails to notice the dangers that lie in front of him. Simone is alluring and methodical. Her damaged psychology is apparent but she\u2019s also shown to be emotionally sensitive and vulnerable. Alternately funny and depraved, WHISPERS BEHIND THE WALL is a dark dizzying exploration of a strange\u2014and ultimately doomed\u2014relationship. (Rodney Perkins)\n\n\t\u00a0",
