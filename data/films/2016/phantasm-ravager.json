    "description": "Phantasm Ravager is the concluding chapter of Don Coscarelli's always independent, unexpected and subversive Phantasm film series. After spanning four decades, Phantasm Ravager completes the story of intrepid ex-ice cream vendor Reggie (Reggie Bannister, a veteran of all five Phantasm films) in his lifelong pursuit of his nemesis, the malevolent Tall Man. In this final entry, Reggie is forced to confront the mysteries of death which always lie at the dark heart of the Phantasm saga. With actor Angus Scrimm's recent passing, Phantasm Ravager stands as the final on-screen acting performance of this iconic horror star. For the first time, Phantasm creator Don Coscarelli has turned over the directing reins to a new, first-time director in Emmy-nominated animator David Hartman. The entire original cast is back including A. Michael Baldwin, Bill Thornbury, Reggie Bannister, Kat Lester and Angus Scrimm. (James Emanuel Shapiro)",
