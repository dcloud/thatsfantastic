    "description": "Quinn Woodhouse longs for something more. He and Thana, his beautiful girlfriend, rent a house from a kindly old man who lives next door. Quinn is a typical starving artist, working in a bar to make ends meet. Just before Christmas, he goes to work like any other night. But when he comes home, Thana has an enigmatic early Christmas present for him. Her behavior is strange and unsettling, but before Quinn can figure out what's going on, he blacks out. When he wakes up the next morning, he finds his entire world crashing down. Once things take their turn, FOLLOW embarks on a tense spiral into the darkest recesses of paranoia and the most inhuman corners of human nature.\n\nOwen Egerton is an accomplished novelist, screenwriter and stage performer. Fantastic Fest audiences may also know him as a founding member of the Master Pancake comedy troupe and, most importantly, the best damn MC ever, proven time and again at our annual Fantastic Debates event. He bursts onto the indie filmmaking scene with his feature directorial debut, for which he also wrote the screenplay.",
