    "description": "It's a cold snowy night. Seligman (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) leaves his home to buy some groceries. On his way home, he comes across a woman named Joe (Charlotte Gainsbourg), lying bloody and beaten in an alley. Joe initially resists his offer of aid, but she soon relents. Once the pair retreat to Seligman's home, a conversation ensues. He's understandably curious about Joe and how she ended up in the alley. Thus begins a bizarre multi-hour conversation in which Joe reveals her life-long pursuit of sexual satisfaction and personal destruction.",
