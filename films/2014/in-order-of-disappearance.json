When he learns of his son\u2019s death, he\u2019s sent into a spiral of depression. With his relationship with his wife strained and nothing left to live for, Nils is moments away from swallowing a bullet when one of his son\u2019s friends offers him some new information. His intense sadness becomes focused rage after he learns his son was murdered. Nils sets out for revenge armed only with determination and heavy machinery, targeting a violent drug cartel led by \u201cThe Count.\u201d\n\n\tDirector Hans Petter Moland\u2019s fourth collaboration with Skarsg\u00e5rd (the last of which, A SOMEWHAT GENTLE MAN, became an instant Fantastic Fest favorite) is an ice cold revenge thriller with a wonderful dose of black humor. As Skarsg\u00e5rd\u2019s Nils finds himself working his way towards his goal, he unwittingly sets into motion even more violent events and no character remains safe in the film\u2019s constant series of surprises. The snowy backdrop is a (forgive the pun) chilling setting for a thriller that is reminiscent in tone to something like FARGO, but with a wholly Scandinavian sensibility. We\u2019re very excited to bring its cold weather and bloodshed to Austin. (Brian Kelley)",
