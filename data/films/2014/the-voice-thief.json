    "synopsis": "Asia Argento stars as a flamboyant opera singer who loses her voice in a row with her husband (Cristobal Jodorowsky aka Axel Jodorowsky, SANTA SANGRE), prompting him to trawl the back alleys of late-night Miami looking for a worthy voice to steal. His sinister adventures lead him to a dwarf prostitute, a transvestite and a garbage heap goddess, who each aid him in his climactic transfiguration. A lush film based on a story by Alejandro Jodorowsky and fueled by the same iconoclastic vision, with music by ROB (MANIAC).",
