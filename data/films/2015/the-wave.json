    "description": "Kristian and his wife Idun have a pretty great life. They have two children and live in the hills above the town of Geiranger, an idyllic vacation spot situated on the shores of a fjord overseen by the Akneset mountain pass in Norway. At any time, the mountain could collapse in a giant rockslide which would crash into the fjord below, creating a tsunami large enough to destroy the entire town. Kristian works as a geologist at a station that constantly monitors the mountain so they can give the occupants a warning to evacuate should the rockslide start. Or, at least, he used to, as he has somewhat reluctantly decided to take a new job with a large oil company. On his last day, two sensors appear to malfunction, and Kristian can't shake the feeling that the doomsday they're all expecting is imminent. He postpones his moving day to investigate the malfunction but has a hard time convincing his colleagues that the mountain is shifting. When more sensors start reporting strange readings, however, Kristian will find his worst fears realized.",
