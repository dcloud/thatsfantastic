    "description": "Screening in a beautiful 35mm print in conjunction with CANNON FILMS / ELECTRIC BOOGALOO.\n\nLookâ€¦ people have their differences. Politics, religion, blah blah blah. But we can certainly all agree that there will never be another human who's 1/10th as powerful, as brutal, as handsome, as all-around perfect as Charles \"Charles Bronson\" Bronson.\n\nSo in celebration of the Cannon Films documentary ELECTRIC BOOGALOO, we're detonating Fantastic Fest with this action demigod's most unconscionably violent movie in 35mm. It's a mindlessly berserk assault on crime... and everything else that can be shot, exploded, bludgeoned or otherwise murdered. Bronson reignites his celebrated vigilante character Paul Kersey for a fully automatic free-for-all into the deepest recesses of heartless, bullet-flavored mayhem. It's the rarest, rippin'-est exercise you'll ever experience in sheer Bronsonism, a.k.a. the undersung art of thunderously destroying your opponents with a bazooka. (Zack Carlson)",
