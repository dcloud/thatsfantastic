    "description": "South Korea's very first animated film to screen at Cannes, THE KING OF PIGS is a time-tripping, soul-shattering mystery about the scars that make us, and the secrets we bleed to keep. Kyung-Min has just killed his wife, but it didn't make him feel any better. His business is failing and he can't stop thinking about his middle school days, back when he was one of the lowly, bullied \"pigs\", the rock-bottom caste of the social animal kingdom, at the mercy of the popular \"dogs\". His old school friend, Jong-Suk, agrees to meet, and each man tells the other polite lies about his wrecked life. But both of them have one thing on their minds: Chul-Yi, their old class comrade, the quiet, deadly boy in the hoodie who fought back against the bullies and became, for one blazing moment in time, The King of Pigs. \"Be my friends,\" he offered, \"and you will never cry.\"",
