    "description": "Young Melanie lives in a compound, somewhere secret. She has done so as long as she can remember. Her life is controlled by routine. Every morning, the soldiers collect her to deliver her to the classroom for lessons. Every evening, after lights out, the doctor visits the cells and sometimes talks to her. But she doesn't understand why the soldiers keep calling her \"an abomination.\" And why does another kid disappears every time the doctor asks her to choose a number from 1-10? And just what exactly is the purpose of the compound?\n\nThe answers to all these questions and more are revealed as the world falls apart and it becomes apparent that young Melanie must go on a journey on which rests the fate of all humanity. Joining her will be the soldier who needs to kill her, the doctor who wants to use her and the teacher who just wants to help.\n\nBased on the best-selling young adult book of the same name, The Girl With All The Gifts is a unique take on a dystopian future and horror tropes which subverts the genre with its clever narrative and brutal approach. Bolstered by standout performances from Glenn Close, Paddy Considine, Gemma Atherton, and (most importantly) newcomer Sennia Nanua, and aided by a desolate, beautiful, crumbling world, this is a big budget horror title with the darkest of sensibilities; a film that dares to ask some very disturbing questions about humanity and presents the most unexpected of answers.
