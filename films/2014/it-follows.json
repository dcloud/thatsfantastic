You should know its borrows from the best\u2014Spielberg\u2019s JAWS, Carpenter\u2019s HALLOWEEN, Nakata\u2019s RINGU, Cronenberg\u2019s THEY CAME FROM WITHIN\u2014but like all good lendees, it takes what it borrows and builds something entirely new.\n\n\tHere you have a teenager, Jay (Maika Monroe following up her performance in another of 2014\u2019s great genre films, THE GUEST), who\u2019s being relentlessly pursued by the absolute definition of irresistible force. No one but Jay can see the force, but it\u2019s evil, patient, deadly, and can\u2019t be killed. No one knows what the force is, where it came from, or what its motives are. You really don\u2019t need to. You just need to know you\u2019ll spend most of the film scanning the screen, nervously trying to spot where it might next attack both Jay and your nerves.\n\n\tAfter director David Robert Mitchell\u2019s 2010 debut THE MYTH OF THE AMERICAN SLEEPOVER was met with widespread acclaim, one wouldn't think a horror film would be his next move. But after watching IT FOLLOWS, it\u2019s easy to see the connections. Both take place in upper-middle class Detroit suburbs, and focus on the angst and fading innocence of its youth. Both films could easily exist in the 1980s: SLEEPOVER with its John Hughes influences, while IT FOLLOWS feels right at home with the aforementioned HALLOWEEN, showcasing wonderful photography by Michael Gioulakis and maybe the year\u2019s best soundtrack, courtesy of Disasterpeace (Rich Vreeland). Mitchell has proved he\u2019s a smart filmmaker that can take tender and sensitive observations about growing up and layer in a narrative that will leave horror fans buzzing for years.
