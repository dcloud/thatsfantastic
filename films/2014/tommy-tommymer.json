And if he doesn\u2019t get what\u2019s his, there\u2019s going to be hell to pay.\n\nFull Description\n\n\tTommy is coming home. He\u2019s been gone for a year now\u2014hiding out, living in exile with his wife and young daughter in Sri Lanka after a job gone wrong\u2014but now he\u2019s coming home. And if he doesn\u2019t get what\u2019s his; if the people who crossed him don\u2019t make it right\u2026 well, then there\u2019s going to be hell to pay. Or at least that\u2019s the message delivered by Tommy\u2019s wife Estelle when she lands in Stockholm with the pair\u2019s young daughter in tow. Tommy himself is mysteriously not to be found.\n\n\tA very different sort of crime film, METROPIA director Tarik Saleh returns to Fantastic Fest with TOMMY. It\u2019s not just the story of the woman behind the man, but of the women\u2014three generations in all\u2014and each of them determined to get what\u2019s theirs by any means necessary.\n\n\tWhere most gangster films end with the job in question (whether it goes right or wrong), Saleh instead unravels his web long after the fact. The actual job is now long past, with the players involved firmly entrenched in their deceits while those around them struggle to cope with the consequences and carve out a livable space for themselves. Saleh ratchets up the tension, not so much with fire power as with the threat of raw brutality and divided loyalties where nobody\u2014not even family\u2014can truly be trusted. Because this is a world where everyone is ultimately out for themselves and betrayal is de rigeur.\n\n\tA sterling example of the current wave of Nordic crime noir\u2019s ability to satisfy genre conventions while simultaneously confounding them, TOMMY is a surprising turn in a new direction from a man who was already one of Sweden\u2019s most intriguing directors.
