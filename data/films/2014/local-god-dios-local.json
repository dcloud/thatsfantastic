    "description": "A young three-piece rock band (played by Mariana Olivera, Gabriela Freire and Agustín Urrutia) set out to write a concept album about their lives. While filming music videos for the album, the trio stumbles across an abandoned gold mine. The mine is guarded by a \"local god\"—an ancient carved idol intended to frighten the mine workers. Once the idol is disturbed by the group, a horrible force is unleashed.\n\nIn 2012, Uruguayan director Gustavo Hernández burst onto the international horror scene with LA CASA MUDA, a feature-length horror film shot in a single take. That film was later remade in English as THE SILENT HOUSE. With his follow up LOCAL GOD, Hernandez delivers a powerful horror film with a singular aesthetic and a deep emotional resonance.\n\nLOCAL GOD, which was written by Santiago Gonzalez, unfolds in three chapters. Each chapter is focused on an individual band member and a song from the album. The spirit unleashed into the underground mine forces the band members to relive the traumatic events that inspired their music. This inventive structure is complemented by hallucinatory atmosphere created through the lush cinematography of DP Pedro Luque (LA CASA MUDA and Fede Alvarez's viral short PANIC ATTACK!). LOCAL GOD is a truly distinctive and powerful film. (Rodney Perkins)\n\nGustavo Hernandez Ibáñez (Director), Annick Mahnert (Executive Producer), Hugues Barbier (Executive Producer), Ignacio Garcia Cucucovich (Producer)",
