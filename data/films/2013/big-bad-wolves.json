    "description": "Writers/Directors Aharon Keshales and Navot Papushado LIVE in attendance!\n\nA serial killer who targets little girls is on the loose. Miki (Lior Ashkenazi) is a rule-breaking cop who thinks that a schoolteacher named Dror (Rotem Keinan) is the murderer. After failing to force Dror's confession, Miki decides to extract a confession through any means necessary. However, a significant obstacle emerges on Miki's path to justice: a man named Gidi (Tzahi Grad).\n\nAaron Keshales and Navot Papushado burst onto the genre film scene with the 2010 cult smash RABIES (KALEVET). The Israeli directing duo have significantly raised the bar with BIG BAD WOLVES, which is a diabolically humorous thriller that gleefully embraces and subverts genre tropes. The setup leads the viewer down a seemingly familiar path. That path is eventually destroyed, thus leaving the viewer on unsure footing for the rest of the film. BIG BAD WOLVES isn't just a smart thriller; it is also a superb black comedy. In lesser hands, injecting dark humor into a revenge thriller about child murder might not have worked. However, Keshales and Papushado get it exactly right. BIG BAD WOLVES is undoubtedly one of the best genre films of 2013. (Rodney Perkins)",
