    "description": "Since you're reading a synopsis for a film playing at Fantastic Fest, you're already aware that illustrated movie posters have developed a culture of their own. How we got here – a place where folks own more movie posters than they have wall space to hang them – is a story about the love of film.\n\nMovie posters have changed over the years because the film industry has changed as well. The days when movie studios could market films in complex ways are over. There was more balance between art and commerce in both studio movie making and movie marketing. Now, films made for artistic reasons are largely made outside of the Hollywood studio system and the methods to market studio films are almost solely focused on what works for audiences who don't want to be creatively challenged, and \"just want entertainment.\" But there are always those who never forgot that the movies they loved could be celebrated in ways beyond just viewing them. Their love for movies extended to their appreciation of illustrated poster art. Just because studio marketing had changed didn't mean that the art of movie posters had to die.\n\n24 x 36 tells this story. Learn how artists like John Alvin and Roger Kastel created iconic posters. See why the poster world changed and most importantly, about the people that helped bring it back: the companies that commission modern posters, the galleries that display them and the fans who collect them.
