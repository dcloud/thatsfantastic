    "description": "Dante (Luis Machín) is a tailor who shares an affliction with his recently deceased brother Tomas: a crippling fear of death and dead things (necrophobia). While at Tomas' funeral, Dante is overwhelmed with fear and comes to believe that someone is following him. Soon, people close to Dante begin to die in gruesome ways. Dante must overcome his necrophobia to solve the mystery that threatens his life and the lives of those around him.\n\nNECROPHOBIA 3D is the latest work from Argentinian director Daniel de La Vega (JENNIFER'S SHADOW). Here, de La Vega has created a thriller directly influenced by Italian giallo, particularly Dario Argento. Unlike a number of recent giallo-inspired films, NECROPHOBIA eschews surrealism and psychedelia in favor of a more formal approach that emphasizes story and suspense. All of the classic giallo signifiers are in place, including a labyrinthine plot, a paranoiac protagonist, a blade-wielding killer dressed in a black topcoat, and a lurid visual scheme full of bright saturated colors.\n\nNECROPHOBIA takes everything a step further. Instead of using music from other films or that mimics previous styles, de La Vega commissioned Claudio Simonetti—founder of the musical group Goblin (composers of music for films such as DEEP RED and SUSPIRIA)—to create an entirely new original score. Restrained use of 3D enhances the film's atmosphere. NECROPHOBIA brings together these elements into create a satisfyingly sinister homage to classic Italian horror.
