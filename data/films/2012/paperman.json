    "synopsis": "The crown jewel topping off the Drawn and Quartered program this year, PAPERMAN introduces a groundbreaking technique that seamlessly merges computer-generated and hand-drawn animation techniques.  First-time director John Kahrs takes the art of animation in a bold new direction using a minimalist black-and-white style.  The short follows the story of a lonely young man in mid-century New York City, whose destiny takes an unexpected turn after a chance meeting with a beautiful woman on his morning commute.",
