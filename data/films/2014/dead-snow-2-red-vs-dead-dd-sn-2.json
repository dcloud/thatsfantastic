    "description": "Picking up right where the first film left off, Martin narrowly escapes Colonel Herzog and his horde of Nazi zombies, losing his arm in the process. But Martin's troubles are just beginning. When he wakes up in the hospital, the police believe that he was the one who killed everyone at the cabin. Not only that, but the doctors have accidentally reattached the wrong limb, giving him Herzog's arm instead of his own. Martin goes on the run with both the police and the Nazis after him, while Herzog's arm tries to kill everyone he meets.\n\nBut the Nazis have bigger plans and Martin must find a way to defeat them. When a child turns him on to the Zombie Squad, a group of professional zombie hunters from America, Martin enlists their help to stop Herzog. The Americans fly to Norway to fight alongside Martin in the ultimate showdown of man vs. Nazi zombie.\n\nWith nods to classic horror films like EVIL DEAD 2, DEAD SNOW 2 is exactly what you want from a movie about Nazi zombies. It's consistently funny and never takes itself too seriously. Full of cheese and ridiculousness, this is a completely over-the-top blood-soaked carnival of craziness.(Luke Mullen)\n\nTommy Wirkola (Director/Co-Writer)",
