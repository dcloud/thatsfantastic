    "description": "In the annals of crime, there have been few organizations quite so evil, quite so pernicious as the dastardly Red Venus. Always plotting on a grand scale, always performing acts of evil and violence to build their own power, Red Venus operates in the shadows - seemingly able to strike anywhere without notice before disappearing with only their signature business card left behind as a demeaning taunt to law and order.",
    "synopsis": "When evil criminal organization Red Venus strikes, there's only one team of highly specialized cops who can help. Unfortunately, they've been dosed with anti-aging gas that has turned them all into children."
