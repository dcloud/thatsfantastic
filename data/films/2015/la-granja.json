    "description": "In one of the barrios of Puerto Rico, Lucho watches her sister and her drug addict boyfriend have sex and get high. Lucho remains quiet, always observing, even when he's running drugs for a local gangster. Although neither of them know it, he crosses paths daily with Ingrid, a nurse at a local hospital for pregnant addicts. Ingrid lives an empty life, lacking human contact except for occasional sex with a local bookie named Rub√©n. She doesn't know that Ruben stages bare-knuckle fights for underage kids and blackmails those who owe him money. There are more characters, all of them circling each other, all of them desperate for some kind of happiness, unaware of the world around them. This is LA GRANJA.",
