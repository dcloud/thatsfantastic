    "raw_body": "Brief Summary\n\n\tOur most highly anticipated addition to that time-honored tradition known as the weirdo Christmas special, this latest stop motion short from Stephane Aubier and Vincent Patar reunites their beloved plastic heroes Cowboy, Indian and Horse for a raucous, forehead-slapping adventure to the North Pole and back again. When Cowboy and Indian ruin Horse\u2019s beautiful yule log, Horse convinces Santa to hold back their presents until they can redeem themselves. But why do that when they can just steal Farmer Steven\u2019s yule log?\n"
