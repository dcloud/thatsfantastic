    "description": "Zoe Bell – best known for her long running collaborations with Quentin Tarantino – is Avery Taggert, an acclaimed photojournalist looking to put some distance between herself and her own dark history when she takes a job in the remote jungles of Colombia. Her subject? A religious group - led by TIMECRIMES helmer Nacho Vigalondo – with their own hidden agenda. It should be a fairly straightforward job, but when Taggert snaps a photo of something she wasn't meant to see, things go very dark very quickly and she ends up running for her life through the hostile jungle.",
