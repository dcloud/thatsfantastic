    "description": "Everyone loves a good horror anthology and the V/H/S series continues to feed that hunger. The latest installment expands the universe and continues a streak of terror, violence and a wicked sense of humor set forth by the previous films. VHS VIRAL brings together Fantastic Fest alumni Nacho Vigalando (TIMECRIMES) and Marcel Sarmiento (DEADGIRL) along with hot genre directors Gregg Bishop (DANCE OF THE DEAD) and Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead (RESOLUTION). With titles like \"Bonestorm\", \"Dante the Great\" and \"Parallel Monsters\", there is something here for every kind of horror fan.\n\nAs a mysterious ice cream truck wreaks havoc on the streets, running down cops and dragging kids to their deaths, teenagers are finding themselves become part of an increasingly chaotic and sinister online phenomenon. And that's just the wraparound story. The VHS VIRAL tales, all featuring inventive uses of the found footage style the series is built upon, jump from a peculiar magician to a garage scientist's bizarre discovery to a rowdy bunch of skateboarders who screw around with the wrong local legend with expectedly bloody results. With three films under its belt, the V/H/S series has made itself into a horror anthology fan's most twisted dream-come-true.
