    "description": "Kang (Kim Yoon-Seok) is the captain of large fishing vessel. The boat's owner wants to sell it, which would put Kang and his crew, including a young man named Dong-sik (K-pop star Yu-Chun Park), out of work. Kang can't afford to buy the boat, but he can't afford to lose it either. In this desperate time, Kang is offered a way out: the highly dangerous job of picking up a group of illegal Chinese-Korean immigrants and bringing them back to Korea. Kang and his crew accept the challenge. Of course, nothing goes as planned.",
