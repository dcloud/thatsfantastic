If BERBERIAN was Strickland's aural roller-coaster ride, BURGUNDY is definitely his visual feast.\n\n\tChiara D\u2019Anna stars as a aspiring lepidopterist, someone who studies moths (I looked it up for you). She has some interesting sexual desires that her lover is more than happy to satisfy. But as her thirst grows, it creates a strain on her\u00a0 relationship. To reveal more would ultimately spoil what is a lush study of relationships and the idea of dominance. The film plays out like a visual poem of quiet beautiful moments with intensely dark relationship exploration\u2026 and lots of lesbian sex.\n\n\tYour preconceptions will bias your perceptions as you witness what people will do for the ones they love. The film takes place almost in an alternate reality where time period and location are indeterminate yet strangely familiar. It's a meditative film, yes, but it's also remarkably intense and will probably teach you a lot about relationships, tips for Birthday gifts and exactly what a human toilet is. (Greg MacLennan)"
