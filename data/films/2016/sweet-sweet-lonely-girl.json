    "description": "Adele (Erin Wilhelmi) is a friendless young woman who is tasked by her mother to move into an oppressively silent mansion and take care of her wealthy but agoraphobic aunt. Adele meets Beth (Quinn Shephard) – glamorous, confident, free-spirited – and the two become fast friends, but Adele may be drawn to a darkness within Beth, a darkness that threatens to overtake everything and forever rift Adele from the peaceful, if lonely, innocence she once knew.\n\nIn SWEET, SWEET LONELY GIRL, writer and director A.D. Calvo (THE MIDNIGHT GAME) nods to Mario Bava and Dan Curtis, offering a Reagan-era horror film that is part haunted house story and part Satanic seduction. The film is stylish and spooky, an elegant examination of the small temptations that can lead us irrevocably astray, and it features two captivating performances in Wilhelmi and Shephard.
