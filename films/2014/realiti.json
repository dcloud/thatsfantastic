He\u2019s always had an inkling that what\u2019s perceived and what\u2019s actually real are not entirely the same thing. In fact, his awareness of this is precisely what has led him to a successful career in the media. But he\u2019s becoming increasingly caught up in the criminal case of a woman who\u2019s trafficking a drug that appears to warp time. When she\u2019s captured with his wallet in hand, Vic realizes this disconnect may run much farther and deeper than he ever suspected, and looking behind the curtain may very well have severe consequences.\n\n\tAfter making his debut with creature feature BLACK SHEEP before moving on to big-budget kid-friendly fantasy UNDER THE MOUNTAIN, New Zealand\u2019s Jonathan King moves again in a surprising direction with his third effort, the micro-budget scifi thriller REALITi. A mind bending puzzle box conceived in part to demonstrate that big ideas are far more important than big budgets, REALITi plays like the bastard love child of Rod Serling and George Orwell as filtered through the classic New Wave. King and writer Chad Taylor create a recognizable but complex world here, riffing on ideas of perception and truth with the whole thing packaged up as a slick crime thriller.\u00a0 A likely next step after a film about cannibal sheep? Not even remotely, but a very pleasant surprise. (Todd Brown)",
