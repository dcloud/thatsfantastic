On his way to the bathroom, Evan bumps into a wanna-be thug, but the inconsequential moment quickly escalates when the guy picks up a bottle. Evan beats the shit out of him. The bar owner fires Evan, leaving him with few options (and the possibility of legal action from the asshole he beat up). Evan makes a spur of the moment decision to fly to Italy to get away from his problems."
