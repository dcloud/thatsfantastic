    "synopsis": "Supremely confident ladies man TK may have bitten off more than he can chew when he sets his sights on Skiets, a township beauty with an edge who sets the pair off on a non-stop rollercoaster ride through the local underworld.",
    "description": "Young TK (Pallance Dladla in his first lead role) is a dangerous sort of charmer, a big fish in a small pond gifted with the sort of natural good looks and confidence that women fall for. And, oh yes, he knows it very well. So well that the time it will take to bed a new arrival at the township restaurant where he works has become a sporting proposition amongst the regular clientele.\n\nBut TK has no idea what he's walking into when he sets his sights on Skiets (the equally fresh-faced Thishiwe Ziqubu), a beautiful young woman who stumbles through the door one day while on the run from small level thugs. Skiets is the sort of challenge TK can't resist. But to have a prayer, he'll have to prove he's her equal in all ways, and that includes her disregard for the law. This scenario results in the pair fleeing town to escape the wrath of a charismatic local gangster, and putting themselves in the line of fire of a much bigger fish in the city while their sexual power game develops into something more significant.\n\nA remarkably accomplished debut from impossibly young writer-director Zee Ntuli \u2013 he was only 25 when the film made its premiere \u2013 HARD TO GET proves remarkably adept at shifting gears from scene to scene, deftly moving from high octane action to steamy romance to shocking violence and sly comedy, all in the blink of an eye. A hugely entertaining ride crafted with skill and gifted with a cadre of hugely charismatic performers put to great use, HARD TO GET is an auspicious debut from a significant talent. (Todd Brown)",
