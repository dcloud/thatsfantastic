    "raw_body": "Brief Summary\n\n\tFantastic Fest is proud to host the US Premiere launch of Spectacular Optical\u2019s first anthology book, KID POWER! \u2014 all about cool, tuff and inspiring kids in cult film and television! Co-edited by Kier-La Janisse and Canuxploitation\u2019s Paul Corupe and featuring writing by a diverse array of genre film criticism\u2019s most unique voices (including Fantastic Fest\u2019s own Zack Carlson), Kid Power! covers the gamut from THE PEANUT BUTTER SOLUTION to THE ABC AFTERSCHOOL SPECIAL and the dark side of Disney. And tons more! The launch will be accompanied by a rare 35mm screening of BUGSY MALONE (1976) and selected short films... plus a real PIE FIGHT!\n\nFull Description\n\n\tReady to get splurged? Celebrate the release of Spectacular Optical\u2019s debut anthology Kid Power with an offbeat slapstick gangster musical that features ruthless mobsters, gin hall singers and hard-nosed cops\u2026 played exclusively by a cast of children. Alan Parker\u2019s BUGSY MALONE showcases the talents of a pre-Chachi Scott Baio and 13-year-old Jodie Foster in perhaps the most elaborate playground game of cops and robbers ever attempted. In the film, Baio, playing the titular role, gets mixed up with one of the pint-sized gangs competing to take over the \u201csarsaparilla racket\u201d by uncovering a cache of the ultimate weapon: tommy-gun like \u201csplurge guns\u201d that\u2014instead of spraying bullets\u2014shoot forth globs of custard that take their recipient out of commission. But what starts as a novelty soon gives way to a genuinely interesting story, supported ably by the pre-teen cast and a sprinkling of Broadway-style song and dance numbers written (and sometimes performed) by Paul Williams. Goofing on the clich\u00e9s of prohibition-era set gangster pics like THE STING, DILLINGER and Robert Altman\u2019s THIEVES LIKE US, the film plays off of the absurdity of miniature mobsters talking up dancers at speakeasies and chasing each other in Model T pedal cars. More importantly, BUGSY MALONE also exemplifies the idea of kid power, as the film\u2019s small stars get the chance to resolve their own issues in a world without parents or adult authority\u2014especially once the story explodes in delicious, creamy warfare. (Paul Corupe)\n\n\tPLUS! True to the nature of the book\u2014which focuses on films wherein kids often have to navigate independently through frightening or \u201cadult\u201d situations\u2014we\u2019ve added a duo of short films that aren\u2019t quite \u201cmade for children,\u201d although they do involve young, misunderstood protagonists who lash out at an uncaring world! (Kier-la Janisse)"
