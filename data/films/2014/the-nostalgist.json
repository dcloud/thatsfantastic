Ignoring his father's instructions, the little boy follows him and learns the horrible truth about the outside world. Based on the award-winning short story by Daniel H. Wilson, THE NOSTALGIST is a stunning example of dystopian sci-fi whose ambitious production design is matched by its poignancy and emotional depth.",
