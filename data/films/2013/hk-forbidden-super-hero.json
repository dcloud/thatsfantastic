    "description": "Aside from his unusual parentage, Kyosuke Shikijo is just like everybody else. Or at least he would like to be. He struggles to be accepted by his peers. He can't seem to make an impression on the girl he likes. He is ordinary. Average. Nondescript, even. But then everything changesâ€¦ Aiko, the object of Kyosuke's desire, is taken hostage by robbers and he acts to save her. But when reaching for a mask to cover his identity, he mistakenly grabs a pair of used women's panties and the odor triggers a strange reaction, the thirst for justice imparted by his father's policeman genes mingling with the perversion of his mother's dominatrix genes, transforming him into a new superhero. The Hentai Kamen (Pervert Mask) is born!",
