    "description": "Somewhere between an absurdist comedy and a realistic French drama lies Quentin Dupieux's new foray into the world of the weird and the mundane. Striking a razor-sharp balance between abject oddity and laugh-out-loud humour, DEERSKIN is a master class in the pitch black humor of the unexpected.\n\nJean Dujardin stars as Georges in what feels like a role tailor-made for him: a middle-aged man on a quest to be the only person wearing a jacket in the whole world. We meet Georges on his way to purchase his new obsession, a 100% deerskin jacket, or \"the jacket of your dreams.\" As Georges' obsession with his overcoat grows, he will find himself recruited by it to rid the world of other outer garments, all the while encountering a series of small town characters, each slowly infected by touches of his madness.\n\nAdapting a visual style clearly influenced by '70s French cinema, Dupieux paints a portrait of rural France not often seen in modern cinema: a place of abject boredom, lonely landscapes, and an array of oddballs suffocated by their lives and their surroundings. The arrival of Georges and his jacket catalyzes the countryside to acknowledge its own share of madness. As the entire world tumbles into some kind of hell, all the audience can do is admire the audacity of one of the most brilliant comedies of the year. (EVRIM ERSOY)",
