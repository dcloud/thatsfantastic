    "description": "Vic is learning a lesson in the elastic nature of reality. He's always had an inkling that what's perceived and what's actually real are not entirely the same thing. In fact, his awareness of this is precisely what has led him to a successful career in the media. But he's becoming increasingly caught up in the criminal case of a woman who's trafficking a drug that appears to warp time. When she's captured with his wallet in hand, Vic realizes this disconnect may run much farther and deeper than he ever suspected, and looking behind the curtain may very well have severe consequences.\n\nAfter making his debut with creature feature BLACK SHEEP before moving on to big-budget kid-friendly fantasy UNDER THE MOUNTAIN, New Zealand's Jonathan King moves again in a surprising direction with his third effort, the micro-budget scifi thriller REALITi. A mind bending puzzle box conceived in part to demonstrate that big ideas are far more important than big budgets, REALITi plays like the bastard love child of Rod Serling and George Orwell as filtered through the classic New Wave. King and writer Chad Taylor create a recognizable but complex world here, riffing on ideas of perception and truth with the whole thing packaged up as a slick crime thriller.Â  A likely next step after a film about cannibal sheep? Not even remotely, but a very pleasant surprise. (Todd Brown)",
