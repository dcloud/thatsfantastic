    "description": "Alamo Drafthouse's favorite son and the unofficial mascot for Fantastic Fest, Nacho Vigalondo blew the indie world away in 2008 with his astonishing debut feature TIMECRIMES before following up with EXTRATERRESTRIAL (2011) and OPEN WINDOWS (2014). But the startling originality in these films didn't come from nowhere; Nacho had already written, directed, produced and acted in a robust body of short films, including 2003's Academy Award®-nominated short film, 7:35 IN THE MORNING.\n\nVigalondo is a force of pure, joyous creativity, and a rare master in the art of having fun. His wild, spastic approach to life is evident in all of his work; even when his protagonists are committing desperate acts of self-destruction, there's still a terminally infectious innocence and vibrance to everything he does. It's the reason why we fell in love with him in the first place, and the reason why his presence has become such an important part of the festival.\n\nDrafthouse Films is pleased to present CONFETTI OF THE MIND, the definitive compilation of Nacho's most brilliant and unforgettable shorts, collected for the first time and personally curated by Nacho and his longtime partner-in-crime Nahikari Ipiña. Featuring such favorites as CHOQUE, SUNDAY, MARISA, and CARLOTA, as well as a fresh introduction and thoughts by the man himself, this is not to be missed. Confetti is not optional.
