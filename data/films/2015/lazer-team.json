    "synopsis": "When Earth is threatened by an advanced alien race, our only hope lies in four morons.",
    "description": "In the late 1970s, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence project receives a message from outer space. There IS intelligent life in the universe, but their message is not one of peace. Instead, they tell Earth that they'll be challenging us to a duel, and a mysterious package is on its way.\n\nFast forward to 2015; the government is on full alert, monitoring the skies for the signal that would indicate the delivery of the package. Meanwhile, the hand-selected \"one true warrior of Earth,\" raised from birth to represent the best of us, waits and trains, trains and waits.\n\nUnfortunately, before the package from space can be retrieved and delivered to Earth's chosen warrior, four morons manage to get their hands on it. Each of them ends up with an individual piece of intergalactic battle armor. Now, all that stands between Earth and complete destruction is this ragtag band of idiots, the self-proclaimed Lazer Team. Survival may prove to be a lot more difficult than anyone ever anticipated.\n\nChanneling the blockbuster science fiction comedies of the '80s, Rooster Teeth's first feature-length effort is the kind of super-enjoyable silliness that we don't get at the movies anymore. Without ever losing track of its science fiction ideals, LAZER TEAM concocts a improbable yet somehow plausible scenario packed with weird aliens, romantic entanglement, massive explosions and enough crude humor to fill three features. Add in some wonderful visuals, high quality special effects, and hilarious performances from the boys, and you have an enticing cocktail that's sure to put a smile on the face of every audience member.
