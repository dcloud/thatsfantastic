    "description": "Director Frank Pavich and Producers Travis Stevens and Steven Scarlata LIVE in attendance!\n\n\nIn the early '70s, Alejandro Jodorowsky achieved international status as the premier director of epic psychedelia with films such as THE HOLY MOUNTAIN and EL TOPO. His next project was to be an adaptation of Frank Herbert's cult sci-fi novel DUNE. Jodorowsky assembled an amazing roster of talent to help realize the film. Dan O'Bannon was the screenwriter. Legendary artists and designers including Jean Giraud (aka Moebius), H.R. Giger and Chris Foss were hired. Pink Floyd and the French prog rock band Magma were to provide the soundtrack. Orson Welles was cast as Baron Harkonen. Salvador Dali was to appear as Shaddam IV at the obscene price of $100K an hour. This elaborate and expensive project was shut down before exiting the pre-production stage.\n\nFrank Pavich's documentary JODOROWSKY'S DUNE tells the behind-the-scenes story of the rise and fall of this legendary cult production. New interviews with numerous key players, including the director himself, H.R. Giger, and Christian Vander of Magma are featured. Rare archival footage is used. In addition to serving as the definitive document of this ill-fated production, JODOROWSKY'S DUNE also explores the failed production's influence—ALIEN probably would not exist if the film had moved forward—and speculates about how the sci-fi cinema landscape might have changed if Jodorowsky's film was actually made.
