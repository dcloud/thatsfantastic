    "synopsis": "Four friends navigate sex, love and life in a heart-breaking new film from Korean auteur and Fantastic Fest favorite Lee Sang-woo.",
    "description": "Seowon, Chuwon, Gurim and Desung have been best friends their whole lives. Gurim is the cool one, always strumming his guitar with young girls hanging on every note. His indifference to the women he attracts drives the other guys nuts. Chuwon is a runner, constantly hoofing along the track at school. It's all he cares about. Seowon is the nerd, and spends most of his time with his nose stuck in a book, convinced that studying will solve everything. And then there's Desung, who's defined by his relationship. The only problem is that the relationship is with his friend Taisek's mom, Mia. But right or wrong, Desung is in love, and first love is a powerful thing. The gang sticks together even when things get tough with their overbearing teacher Mr. Park.",
