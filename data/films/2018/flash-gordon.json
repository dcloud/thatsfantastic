    "description": "He's here to save every one of us! Heroic earthling Flash Gordon protects the world from the nefarious Ming the Merciless in this lavish, majestically camp adaptation of Alex Raymond's legendary sci-fi comic strip.\n\nThe story is space opera purity at its finest: Ming (Max von Sydow) has developed a plan to destroy the Earth, and Flash (Sam J. Jones) and his companion, Dale Arden (Melody Anderson), are called upon to stop him. Along the way, Flash must battle Ming's goons and the temptations of a luscious space princess.\n\nAn ecstatic explosion of comic-inspired production design and visual resplendence, every flamboyant flourish is exaggerated for maximum pleasure. FLASH GORDON is closer in tone to the 60's Batman series than Star Wars, which makes sense given that the film is written by the versatile Lorenzo Semple Jr., a central creative force in that cartoonish tour de force. To begin to understand the unrestrained joy that this film can bring to you, just know that it features lauded Shakespearean Brian Blessed as some sort of winged Hawkman who delightedly bellows \"Who wants to live forever?\" while swooping into battle looking like the universe's most glorious leather daddy. And the whole thing is set to an iconic score by Queen.",
