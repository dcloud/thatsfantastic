    "description": "The year is 1987. The location is the Spanish city of Seville. In a few years, people from all over the world will descend on the city for Expo '92. In anticipation of the international publicity, Seville's government initiates wide-sweeping changes, including a plan to flush the streets of drugs and prostitution. Angel (Mario Casas from NEON FLESH), a young cop trying to rise in the ranks, is assigned to the anti-drug squad: the titular Unit 7. Angel is a rube amongst a group of rough vets, including Rafeal (Antonio De La Torre from THE LAST CIRCUS and VOLVER); Miguel (Jose Manuel Poga); and Matthew. The group takes up the mandate to clean up Seville's slums with zealous brutality. Their smash-mouth tactics yield big successes but also create serious problems that may prove beyond the group's ability to control.",
