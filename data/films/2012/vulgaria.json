    "description": "You may only know Pang Ho Cheung from his famously over-the-top violent social commentary slasher DREAM HOUSE. While he has bounced around between genres, he certainly seems particularly at home working in comedy. From his breakout hit MEN SUDDENLY IN BLACK to LOVE IN A PUFF and its sequel LOVE IN THE BUFF he has proven time and again he has a slick sense of humor and a knack for satire. In his latest film, VULGARIA, he turns his wit towards the movie industry.",
