    "synopsis": "An unhinged elderly woman moves in with her significantly younger drug-addled brother in this abrasive psycho-comedy from the filmmaker that brought last year's mind-melting MY JOHNNY. Exceptionally outrageous performances abound and escalate in eccentricity with each passing hilarious minute, and though De Ghoulie's aggressive experimental style has grown more refined, his aesthetics are still as provocative and anarchic as ever.",
