    "description": "The Apocalypse has come and gone; its survivors forming small communities for protection. Banished to the vast Wasteland, Isaac - a giant humanoid panda - sets out to find a young girl and reinstate his family into the Tribe of Legion.\n\nThe idea is preposterous on the surface â€“ a web series fusing elements of Mad Max, Lone Wolf And Cub and Zatoichi revolving around a walking, talking, sword fighting panda bear. It's the sort of thing that simply should not work, not at all, or at least not without descending into wild camp. And yet it does work. And it works in no small part because talented writer-director Victoria Cocks plays things absolutely, one hundred percent straight. There is nothing camp here, not at all. And, yes, Cocks will make you buy in to the emotional plight of her furry protagonist.\n\nDriven by the force of its creator's vision and her team's remarkable ability to build complex and compelling worlds seemingly for pocket change, Wastelander Panda has become a sort of organically growing beast with an initial proof of concept video going viral and sparking chatter around the world, leading to a three episode prologue arc released for free online in 2013 to prove they could actually carry a proper story and now leading to this: Six ten minute episodes, hopefully leading to a full television series and feature film outings, which we are very proud to bring to audiences for the very first time.(Todd Brown)\n\nVictoria Cocks (Co-writer, Director), Kristy Stark (Producer), Nick Batzias (Producer)",
