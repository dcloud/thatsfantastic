    "description": "If revenge is known as cinema's most pure motivation, then surely redemption is its most complicated. Such is the case for FATAL's main character Sung-gong, forever haunted by his forced inclusion in a brutal gang rape ten years ago. Now leading a solitary life, Sung-gong fatefully runs into a Christian youth group who could possibly offer him the salvation he desperately needs. Things aren't that easy, as the road to forgiveness will force him to confront his past when he discovers the rape victim is a member of his new church."
