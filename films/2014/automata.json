He\u2019s investigating an insurance claim on a faulty robot that leads to greater discoveries.\u00a0 Plays like BLADE RUNNER for a bit, then\u2026 it is its own film. Fantastic!\n\nFull Description\n\n\tIf you love post-apocalyptic cinema, this one\u2019s for you. We have a walled city. Vast radiation zones. Rumors persist that there\u2019s still an ocean somewhere. However, it\u2019s not all doom and gloom. We have robots to make our lives easier. Some models even have sex. When a robot malfunctions or is damaged, an Insurance Investigator from the ROC Robotics Corporation is on the case. In our story, mild mannered insurance agent Jacq Vaucan is played by Antonio Banderas. He\u2019s burnt out, an expectant father and living in a world that isn\u2019t particularly soothing. Robert Forster plays his boss, Birgitte Hjort Sorensen is Mrs. Vaucan, Melanie Griffith modifies androids into sex-bots that she also provides the voices for. \u00a0\n\n\tThe feel of this film is that of mystery. It establishes two laws for the robots which should make them safe for humanity. While researching a damaged robot that was apparently violating the 2nd command, the investigation becomes about discovering how this happened and if the robot was the only one. Director Gabe Ibanez creates a post-apocalyptic robotic noir that I know will win over the Fantastic Fest crowd! This is FANTASTIC!!!(Harry Knowles)\n\n\t\u00a0"
