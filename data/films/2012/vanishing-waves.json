    "description": "Lukas's life is going pretty well. He's living with Lina, his girlfriend of several years and she's supportive of Lukas's work despite the grueling schedule. His hard work is paying off as the research team he's a part of is getting ready to start its first human trials with a new technology he helped to develop; one that will allow thoughts to be transferred digitally from one person to another. Lukas has volunteered to be the receiver, having already completed experiments receiving thought signals from a computer. But this is the real test; an actual transfer of thoughts from a comatose patient directly into Lukas's brain. The reduced brain activity of a comatose patient should offer a more manageable amount data for the system to track and transfer. The experiment is setup as a double blind test, meaning that Lukas will have no knowledge of the comatose patient, just as the patient has no knowledge of Lukas. The digital system is set up like a one-way street. Information passes from the source to Lukas but cannot go the opposite direction, meaning that interactivity is not possible. Instead it simply serves as a window through which Lukas can view the patient's thoughts.",
