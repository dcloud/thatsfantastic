    "description": "Gilderoy (Toby Jones) is a fragile audio technician who mostly works on nature documentaries. In 1976, he is summoned from his home in England to work for an Italian production company on an unspecified project. Upon his arrival, Gilderoy learns that has been hired to work on an ultra-violent giallo film called THE EQUESTRIAN VORTEX. Under the supervision of director Giancarlo Santini (Antonio Mancino) and producer Francesco Coraggio (Cosimo Fusco), Gilderoy creates audio landscapes full of gibbering goblins, orgasmic witches, and squished heads. Gilderoy's sense of unease about his job is raised to unbearable levels as his life becomes increasingly similar to THE EQUESTRIAN VORTEX.",
