    "synopsis": "Ryan Haysom's ultra-stlylized, synth-fueled neo-giallo blends the subjective impulses and misanthropy of Gerald Kargl's ANGST with the trappings of the Italian murder mystery: whispered threats, catholic retribution, cartographic obsession, black gloves, straight razors and the obligatory J&B Whiskey. A mood piece that never strays from its influences while simultaneously offering an unexpected twist on the genre.",
