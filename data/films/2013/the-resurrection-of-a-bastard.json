    "description": "Ronnie is a bastard. And not just any bastard. Ronnie is an EXCEPTIONAL bastard. The hardest of the hard men, a gleefully heartless collector of debts and dispenser of violence whose world comes crashing down around him when a taste of his own violence splashes back upon himself. The near-death experience leaves Ronnie questioning the meaning and value of his life up until that point. But not so much that he doesn't want revenge on the person who left him near-dead.\n\n\nA richly complex, beautifully executed character piece adapted from his own graphic novel by first time writer-director Guido van Driel, RESURRECTION OF A BASTARD showcases a sly sense of gallows humor, attention to detail, and an easy way with characters that puts many better established, more widely known filmmakers to shame. Like last year's Fantastic Fest award-winning PLAN C, RESURRECTION OF A BASTARD fleshes out its truly remarkable writing with such fabulous performances and an understatedly slick sense of style that it leaves you wondering what exactly is going on in Holland to produce such unique, strong voices. Fans of the Coen Brothers and recent Scandinavian fare such as A SOMEWHAT GENTLE MAN should take note: You're about to discover a new favorite. (Todd Brown)",
