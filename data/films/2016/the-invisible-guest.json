    "description": "Everything is working out for Adrian Doria. His business has brought him wealth. His beautiful wife has given him the perfect child, and his just-as-beautiful mistress is content with their affair being hidden. Everything's great until Doria awakens after being struck in the head and finds his lover dead in the bathroom, covered with one million euros. Worse, the hotel room is locked from the inside and there isn't any way in or out of the room. With all he has built crumbling at his feet, Doria turns to Spain's best defense lawyer, Virginia Goodman, and through the course of one edge-of-your-seat evening, they find a path to what actually happened the night before.\n\nGood mysteries for intelligent viewers are unfortunately becoming harder and harder to find as mid-budget films are largely turning into long-form television programs. Leave it to Spain and filmmaker Orio Paulo (THE BODY; writer of JULIA'S EYES) to deliver a Hitchcockian thriller that keeps its narrative changing, full of great performances and a terrific score. Our main goal for Fantastic Fest is to scour every corner of the Earth for the best genre films of the year and it took an epic search to find something increasingly rare these days: a smart mystery for adults.
