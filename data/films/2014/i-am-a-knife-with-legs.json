He's dealing with a host of problems: his girlfriend was recently killed by a suicide bomber, a fatwa has been issued against him, and his delicious looking eclair is, sadly, \"weird.\" With only his manager Beefy to keep him company, Ben\u00e9 develops security strategies and disguises, writes songs and plays with his neighbor's cat as he waits for the inevitable onslaught of would-be assassins."
