    "description": "Matvei is a normal, loving boyfriend. So when his girlfriend Olya asks him to kill her father, explaining that he assaulted her when she was a young teen, Matvei does what anyone would do: he shows up at Olya's parents' apartment with a hammer, ready to do the deed. But Olya left out some key details, like the fact that her father Andrei is a cop, and that Matvei has unwittingly brought a hammer to a gunfight. Plus Andrei is not just any cop: he's basically the Russian Vic Mackey, with a long string of dirty dealings, any one of which could have come back to bite him in the ass. So after their initial brawl, the kid ends up handcuffed to the pipes in the shower while Andrei tries to figure out who the hell he is, and why he's come to kill him.\n\nWriter/director Kirill Sokolov's first feature film is an impressive display of technical craftsmanship, solid stunt work, and an ample amount of blood. Sokolov utilizes exaggerated close-ups, snap zooms, and slick camera moves to pull you in and ratchet up the tension. The sound design is fantastic, and the stomach-turning sound effects sell the pain of broken bones, cracking skulls, bodies flying into walls, and so much more. The fights are wild, chaotic, and occasionally seem to defy the laws of physics. This is a raucous, roller-coaster ride of a film, filled with crazy action from the first frame to the blood-soaked conclusion. (LUKE MULLEN)\n\nWith Director Kirill Sokolov in Attendance for 2nd half.",
