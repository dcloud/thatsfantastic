    "description": "Big Shim has a hardened glare with a cone bra to match, and this tough gal commands the SHE MOB! Leading a gang of escaped prisoners to a farmhouse hideaway, Big Shim sets the rules and keeps her ladies in line. When they want to get their kicks, they hire Tony the Gigolo for a little company — much to Big Shim's chagrin. But when she finds out Tony is being kept by a wealthy woman, she turns the housecall into a kidnapping. With gal pal Baby trying to help Tony escape, and a detective named Sweetie East closing in, it seems the only ransom Big Shim may collect is Tony's family jewels!\n\nA standout among the \"roughie\" era of sexploitation, and a hit on VHS and DVD for Something Weird, SHE MOB has it all: textured B&W cinematography with questionable framing, women taking charge in standard-issue 1960s lingerie, and Twig, a Goldie Hawn look-alike who never stops dancing! Indecent by any standards — Big Shim rules the roost in all her butch glory, rendering a compelling, albeit caricatured, portrayal of lesbianism — SHE MOB is an uproarious tale of kidnapping and castration.\n\nAGFA and Something Weird are thrilled to present the world premiere of this 2K preservation with Something Weird head honcho Lisa Petrucci in person! (ALICIA COOMBS)\n\nWith Something Weird boss lady Lisa Petrucci in Attendance.",
