    "description": "A quick Google search will reveal several websites calling The Kingdom of Little People one of the world's \"most offensive\" theme parks. The park, located in China, is home to over a hundred performers, all of whom have dwarfism and put on elaborate shows for snapshot-happy tourists. Director Matthew Salton takes his cameras to China to meet with the people living here, as well as with the park's creator and manager, to get a real feel about how those that actually rely on the park for their livelihood feel about the potentially exploitative attraction.",
