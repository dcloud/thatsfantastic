    "description": "Directors Jonah Bekhor and Zach Math LIVE in attendance!\n\n\nSince 1974, Sigurdur \"Siggi\" Hjartarson has run the Icelandic Phallological Museum, which houses the world's largest collection of mammalian penises. Siggi's private collection runs the gamut from microscopic to gargantuan, including penises from whales, dogs, pigs, bears, bulls and hamsters. Siggi believes that his museum—and his legacy—will be incomplete without an important addition to his museum: a human penis of \"legal length.\" After years of searching, he tracks down two donors: an aging Icelandic philanderer and a weirdo from California who refers to his penis as \"Elmo.\" Siggi's quest for penile perfection morphs into a race against time as the donors compete to become the first human to have their members severed and preserved for posterity.\n\n\nWith THE FINAL MEMBER, co-directors Jonah Bekhor and Zach Math have created one of the most unique and memorable documentaries in recent years. The film initially seems like a quaint exploration of a single man's weird obsession, but evolves into a deep character study of three dudes who are pathologically obsessed with male genitalia—human or otherwise. Siggi uses his museum to break sexual taboos and educate the public. The Icelandic ladies' man wants to preserve his rapidly aging penis before it shrinks down to the size of a raisin. Unlike his aging counterpart, the cowboy wants to chop his off before he dies. THE FINAL MEMBER delivers everything one could want from a documentary—it's emotionally engaging, funny, and highly disturbing. (Rodney Perkins)",
