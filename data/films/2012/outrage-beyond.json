    "description": "In the five years that have passed since the events of Takeshi Kitano's OUTRAGE, the Sanno crime family has grown into a huge organization, expanding its power into politics and legitimate big business. Exasperated at the Sanno's rapidly increasing eminence, the police force prepares for a full-scale crackdown on this huge yakuza syndicate. The Sanno's upper ranks are now dominated by young executives, and the old-guard members are filled with resentment while being pushed to the sidelines. This vulnerable spot in the Sanno hierachy is exactly what anti-gang detective Kataoka has been looking for.\n\n\nThe police decide to take advantage of a situation concerning them and their supposed ally in the western region, the Hanabishi. Detective Kataoka (Fumiyo Kohinata), devises a plot to set the delicately balanced allies against each other. He also reveals an appalling truth about Otomo (Beat Takeshi), a yakuza who was supposedly killed in jail during the last war, but is indeed alive. Kataoka plans to use Otomo as his trump card and arranged his early release on parole to be used as leverage to annihilate the yakuza. As the police force carrying out their plot and two organizations plunging themselves into a conflict, what move will Otomo make?",
