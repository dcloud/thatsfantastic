    "description": "Director Nacho Vigalondo and Composer Eugenio Mira LIVE in attendance!\n\n\nTwo of FF's most beloved brothers are Nacho Vigalondo and Eugenio Mira. For many years now, they have been the heart (attack) and brain (aneurysm) of the festival, supplying us with not only incredible films, but an unbelievable amount of joyous, unforgettable chaos. Our love affair with both of them began with 2007's TIMECRIMES, Vigalondo's precariously perfect scifi masterpiece, powered by a soaring, unique score by Mira. Claustrophobic but wild, alternately dark and playful, the music complements the film's lawless but controlled structure perfectly.\n\n\nNow, six years later, MONDO presents a repertory screening to celebrate the release of the TIMECRIMES soundtrack on limited edition vinyl. The soundtrack will be available for the first time at this event. Come close out the fest with us at Mondo's first ever album release party. With Eugenio Mira & Nacho Vigalondo in attendance!",
