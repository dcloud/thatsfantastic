    "description": "Director Errol Morris LIVE in attendance! \n\n\nAs a high-level executive under four American presidents, Donald Rumsfeld dictated many memos. By his own account, Rumsfeld created millions of memos—he refers to these memos as \"snowflakes\"—over the course of multiple decades. In THE UNKNOWN KNOWN, documentarian Errol Morris uses this sea of documents to guide Rumsfeld through a discussion of the peaks and valleys of his political career. Like a boxer in a ring, Rumsfeld bobs and weaves his way around Morris' probing questions about the Cold War, Desert Storm, the War on Terror, and other controversial topics. What emerges from these conversations—or are they interrogations?—is a complex and highly nuanced portrait of one of America's most divisive public figures. (Rodney Perkins)",
