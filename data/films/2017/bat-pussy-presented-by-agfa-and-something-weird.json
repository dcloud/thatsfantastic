    "description": "CONTENT WARNING: This movie contains scenes that will rot your libido.\n\nThe citizens of Gothum City are under attack by smut filmmakers. And only one hero can help! Bat Pussy (Dora Dildo) hangs out in her secret headquarters (a.k.a. an outhouse). When her \"twat begins to twitch,\" warning her of imminent crime, Bat Pussy hops on her Holy Hippity-Hop to foil the grotesque sex schemes of unhappily married couple Buddy and Sam!\n\nProduced by anonymous dirtbags in an unknown 1970s wasteland, BAT PUSSY is considered to be the first smut parody in history. This fact simultaneously explains everything and nothing. On paper, this movie is what happens when a porn producer gets inspired by the 1960s Batman TV show but only has $5. In reality, this movie is what happens when your wildest dreams and most horrifying nightmares collide in an explosion of flaccid stupefaction. The lunatic filmmakers have never been identified, providing further proof that this movie was most likely made by extraterrestrials. BAT PUSSY is the unforgettable and anti-erogenous superheroic adventure that a Decidedly Cool comic book company hoped you would never see.\n\nAGFA is beyond excited to present a brand new 2K transfer of this legendary sexploitation paradox from Something Weird's 16mm print â€” the only one in existence. For this screening, we'll be joined by Lisa Petrucci, the inspiring co-founder of Something Weird, in person!\n\nIn the words of Bat Pussy herself: \"No dirty muthafuckas are fuckin' in my holy Gothum City without me!\" (Joseph A. Ziemba)",
