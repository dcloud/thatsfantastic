    "description": "Sam (Maurice Luijten) scrambles to meet his boy scout troop for their yearly camping trip. After everyone has arrived and things settle down, troop leaders Chris and Peter warn the kids that an intruder—a feral boy named Kai—has been seen lurking around the campsite. The story of Kai is just a tactic to frighten the kids and add some mystery to the outing. Upon arrival at the camp site—which is plagued by some obnoxious locals—Sam sees and hears things that make him believe that Kai is real. No one believes Sam, but the brutal reality behind myth of Kai soon becomes apparent to all of the disbelieving cubs.",
