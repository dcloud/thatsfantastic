Yes, and just wait until you meet the people who study them \u2026\n\nFull Description\n\n\tWho says you need a work of fiction to take you to the far reaches of space to explore the unusual, beautiful and strange? Too often we forget that world around us is positively littered with the odd and the alien. So enter directors Jasper Sharp and Tim Grabham with their gorgeously photographed documentary The Creeping Garden to remind us.\n\n\tEnter the world of the slime mould, a microbial life form that exists in thousands of species all around us but is seldom acknowledged or studied. Yes, the faint of heart will be warned off by their very name and, yes, they can be rather slimey. But viewed in time lapse macro photography \u2013 as they are throughout the film \u2013 these are weirdly alien and beautiful structures, pulsating with life as they form patterns and overcome obstacles with what scientists believe are signs of primitive intelligence.\n\n\tAnd as compelling (read: odd) as the moulds themselves are they are nothing compared to the people who have built their lives around them. Sharp and Grabham take a sort of Errol Morris approach to their subjects \u2013 scientists, artists and amateur enthusiasts \u2013 leaving them free to wax poetic about their most unusual obsession leading the viewer to conclude that perhaps some of the humans around us are every bit as alien as the things that grow unseen in the dark and perhaps the world is a better \u2013 or at least more interesting \u2013 place because of it.(Todd Brown)"
