    "description": "Twelve-year-old Conor, dealing with his mother's illness, unexpectedly summons a most unlikely ally – a 40-foot-high Monster – in Fantastic Fest alum J.A. Bayona's third feature film, A MONSTER CALLS. With both THE ORPHANAGE and THE IMPOSSIBLE, Bayona has proven his skills at finding the emotional core of his stories, and helping his actors give performances that breathe life into those emotions. A MONSTER CALLS is no different in that regard. Bayona walks a very fine line with a movie that could easily fall into cheesiness and schmaltz. It's no small feat to avoid that and yet he's made it look rather easy, thanks in no small part to the terrific performance of Lewis MacDougall – in only his second movie – as Conor. A MONSTER CALLS – adapted by Patrick Ness from his award-winning novel – is a beautiful, funny, and heartwarming film that's sure to be the cause of more than a few tears. (Luke Mullen)",
