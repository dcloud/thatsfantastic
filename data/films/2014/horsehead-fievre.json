Jessica returns home to attend her grandmother's funeral. Her mother (legendary Euro-horror stalwart Catriona MacColl) decides to hold the wake in the house and forces Jessica to sleep next door to her grandmother's body. While staying in the house, Jessica's nightmares become worse. Grotesque repeated imagery of family members begins to appear in her dreams. She decides to apply her knowledge of lucid dreaming to find the source of the horrible visions."
