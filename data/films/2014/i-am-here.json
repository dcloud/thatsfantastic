    "description": "After making his debut with the violent revenge tale PRINCESS in 2007, director Anders Morgenthaler is back with another tale sure to cause controversy.\n\nKim Basinger stars as Maria, a powerful business executive who's been desperately trying to have a child despite a string of miscarriages. When a doctor informs her that she's too old to carry a baby, Maria's world disintegrates. Refusing to accept her fate, she sets out on a journey that will see her cross paths with a junkie and some very dangerous people, and lead her to an end she never would have expected.\n\nMarking the comeback of Kim Bassinger, I AM HERE is provocative filmmaking from the man who shook our world with PRINCESS in 2007. Taking the same no-holds-barred approach as that visceral film, Morgenthaler challenges the audience's perceptions of vulnerability, power and emotional disturbance by exploring the soul of a very damaged character who still may manage to achieve her dreams. Uncompromising to the highest degree, he populates the world with losers, con-men and violent criminals whose nihilism correlates perfectly with the dead-eyed quest of our lead. Add to this some fantasy sequences which may or may not be the result of a delusional mind, and you have a highly volatile mix which is sure to spark the imagination of any audience member. The fact that Morgenthaler remains impassive and non-judgemental in the face of all that occurs only heightens the tension and the involvement of the audicence.\n\nQuiet but brutal, I AM HERE features incredible performances from Kim Basinger, Peter Stormare and Jordan Prentice, and will be a hot topic of discussion for anyone who sees it.
