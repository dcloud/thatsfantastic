    "description": "A village is being evacuated to make way for a dam. The residents are being paid to move. In their time of need, the displaced people rely on the healing powers of Sung, a charismatic preacher who promises to build them a new church and housing. In exchange, the villagers give the pastor all of their money. Min-chul (voiced by Yang Ik-june of BREATHLESS and KING OF PIGS fame) is a drunken hellraiser who has just been released from jail. Immediately after returning home, he gets into a bar fight. He soon discovers that the man he fought in a bar is a con artist who works for Pastor Sung. Min-chul sets out to expose the church as a fraud. Min-chul has one major obstacle standing in his way: nobody believes him."
