But unlike her teen years, when she could simply walk out on mom\u2019s nattering, Kylie\u2019s ankle bracelet ensures she stays in close range of mom at all times, lest she serve out her sentence in prison. But as tedious as her mother\u2019s belief in the supernatural may be, Kylie must face an even worse reality: Her mother may actually be right and that their house (which she can\u2019t legally leave), may actually be haunted.\n\n\tRemember the name of Gerard Johnstone, because I guarantee you\u2019re going to be hearing a lot more from this talented Kiwi in the future. Blending wry comedy, richly drawn characters and legitimate scares, Johnstone\u2019s HOUSEBOUND is one of the most impressive debut films in years. Johnstone has a rare gift for switching gears on a dime and he puts it to great use, running the audience through a gamut of emotions\u2014pinballing from laughter to fright\u2014in this hugely entertaining crowd-pleaser.\n\n\tRegular Fantastic Fest attendees will know that the festival normally will not play any films that have previously played in Texas, and definitely not ones which have played in Austin. So why is HOUSEBOUND here after premiering at SXSW? Because it\u2019s fucking fantastic and we\u2019d be idiots not to show it. That\u2019s why. (Todd Brown)",
