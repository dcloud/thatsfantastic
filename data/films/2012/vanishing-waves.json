    "description": "Lukas's life is going pretty well. He's living with Lina, his girlfriend of several years and she's supportive of Lukas's work despite the grueling schedule. His hard work is paying off as the research team he's a part of is getting ready to start its first human trials with a new technology he helped to develop; one that will allow thoughts to be transferred digitally from one person to another. Lukas has volunteered to be the receiver, having already completed experiments receiving thought signals from a computer. But this is the real test; an actual transfer of thoughts from a comatose patient directly into Lukas's brain. The reduced brain activity of a comatose patient should offer a more manageable amount data for the system to track and transfer. The experiment is setup as a double blind test, meaning that Lukas will have no knowledge of the comatose patient, just as the patient has no knowledge of Lukas. The digital system is set up like a one-way street. Information passes from the source to Lukas but cannot go the opposite direction, meaning that interactivity is not possible. Instead it simply serves as a window through which Lukas can view the patient's thoughts.\n\nDespite a few false starts, the system works perfectly, though the presence of another person in the thoughts is a surprise, one that Lukas decides to keep to himself to avoid controversy that could terminate the experiments. He's fascinated and awe-struck by the clarity and depth of the brain activity he is experiencing, though it's unclear if they're current thoughts or dreams or memories. The other person he continues to see is also a mystery, though an enticing one that slowly takes over Lukas's every waking thought. As he is drawn more and more into the life of the patient, he finds himself willing to sacrifice almost anything to continue the experiments and discover the truth.\n\nVanishing Waves is a powerful sci-fi drama, with roots in films like The Cell and Inception while also calling to mind elements of Almodovar's Talk to Her. The film features beautiful cinematography along with a fantastic score that perfectly underscore a great story. Modern, slick and stylish, VANISHING WAVES is an incredible cinematic journey that will draw you in and keep you wanting more. (Luke Mullen)",
