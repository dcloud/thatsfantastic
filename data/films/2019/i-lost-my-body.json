    "description": "Poetic and deeply moving, I LOST MY BODY is a lyrical journey that combines the best elements of handmade animation with the quirky trappings of genre film. Essentially a dramatic poem told through the viewpoint of a severed hand, the narrative not only operates as an adventure but also a deep rumination on the nature of what it is to be human.\n\nA severed hand comes alive in a laboratory in Paris, ready to be dissected. Determined to escape this unhappy fate, it sets off on a one-of-a-kind adventure across the city, taking on enemies and obstacles of all kinds with one singular goal in mind: to reunite with Naoufel, a young pizza boy, who has hopelessly fallen in love with Gabrielle.\n\nBy cleverly limiting the viewpoint to that of a severed hand, I LOST MY BODY gives the audience a chance to experience a familiar story through very unfamiliar eyes. As the journey across Paris gets more and more perilous with pigeons and rats and other hurdles in the way, the hand remembers its life up until the moment of severance, each moment filtered through the way a hand might experience the world: the sensation of objects, the awkwardness of movement, the lyricism that lies in the motion of the body.\n\nUsing a hand-drawn animation style, the film depicts Naoufel and Paris in a way that makes the whole setting come alive. Combining nuanced and complex characters with a fantastical backdrop, director Jérémy Clapin creates a compelling world in which all seems possible. (EVRIM ERSOY)",
