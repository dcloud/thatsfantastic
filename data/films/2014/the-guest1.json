    "description": "A family grieves over the loss of their soldier son Caleb. A soldier named David (Dan Stevens of DOWNTON ABBEY fame) arrives on the doorstep. He's strikingly handsome, incredibly polite and, most importantly, on a mission given to him by Caleb before he died. Integrating himself into their lives, he helps console Caleb's mother, teaches Caleb's brother Luke how to stand up to bullies, and is the keg-toting savior at a party that Caleb's dubious sister Anna is attending. Anna's rising skepticism soon proves to be well-founded. David, as it turns out, has finely tuned skills that include more than impeccable table manners, and his proclivity for violence soon leaves the bodies piling up.\n\nTHE GUEST is the kind of movie that turns young, future Fantastic Fest fans into genre-loving fiends. Expertly written by Simon Barrett and directed by Adam Wingard (the team behind genre-fan favorite YOU'RE NEXT as well as A HORRIBLE WAY TO DIE), it's an action thriller that's as smart as it is fun, recalling a time when it was totally fine to just have a damn good night at the movies, yet still leave with something to ponder. Stevens is born for this role, and his split-second shifts from god-sculpted gentleman to callous killer lead to a constant string of crowd-pleasing moments. It's equal parts action, horror, comedy and thriller; a perfect blend of every type of movie we love. (Brian Kelley)\n\nSimon Barrett (Writer), Adam Wingard (Director)",
