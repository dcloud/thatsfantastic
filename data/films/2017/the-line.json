    "description": "Adam Krajnak is the head of an organized crime family that operate on a border, dealing in guns, cigarettes, even illegal immigrants. Everything but narcotics. He's loyal to his men and puts his family above all else. When Slovakia becomes part of the Schengen area, Adam's business is threatened by the new border laws. Add to the mix his daughter's impending marriage, his partner beginning to rebel and an old enemy threatening him, and a perfect storm starts to brew.\n\nPeter Bebjak's entry into the gangster genre may have elements of familiarity. but assured direction and flawless acting push it to the top of its class. Boasting an unusual locale and borrowing heavily from headlines in today's world news, Bebjak melds politics into gangsters and clashes it violently with a very Eastern European focus on family, creating a story that is fresh as it is violent. Tomáš Maštalír's performance as Adam is both terrifying and charismatic; his imposing physical presence is used to electric effect as he tears through the harshness of his crumbling reality.\n\nA success on home ground, THE LINE heralds the arrival of a new voice who's crafting something unexpected from familiar elements. Do not miss the chance to engage with what is one of the most thrilling, visceral experiences of the entire year. (Evrim Ersoy)",
