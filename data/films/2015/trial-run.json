    "synopsis": "A pop-up ad on a porn site leads an unemployed and unstable man on a convoluted cross-country mission to recover a litany of mysterious corpses with the promise of sexual fulfillment. A kinetic and compelling menagerie of conspiratorial musings and manic ruminations instilled with a delirious momentum reminiscent of Craig Baldwin's Tribulation 99 monologues, as if performed by a deranged Jack Burton.",
