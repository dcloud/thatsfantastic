    "description": "In many ways, Marisa is a normal working-class German teen. She lives with her mother and works at the family store. She also adores her sickly grandfather, an ex-Nazi soldier, and Adolf Hitler. Marisa, along with her brutal skinhead boyfriend Sandro, are fierce promoters of the Nazi cause—their bodies are adorned with elaborate Third Reich tattoos, they hurl racist epithets at strangers, and occasionally back up their hateful words with violent acts. In contrast, Svenja is an apolitical suburban girl. Her rebellious tendencies manifest in mostly benign ways like smoking cigarettes in secret. Svenja finds a boyfriend who travels in Marisa's circle of friends, and eventually Marisa and Svenja's paths intersect in ominous ways.",
