    "description": "Leo Woeste (Jeremie Renier) is in many ways the prototypical homicide cop. He's driven, focused, and in many ways married to the job. But he's also married to Kathleen and does his best to be a father figure to his young step son and so when he learns that Kathleen is pregnant with their first child he makes a firm decision: His next case will be his last. He chooses his family of the job, not realizing that this last job will pull him so deeply into his own darkness that his family may never recover.\n\nThe murder Leo must crack is of a young Congolese man, the clues leading him farther and farther into an enigmatic underworld of tribal mysticism and the illicit trade in religious artifacts. The crime also brings Leo into the seemingly irresistible magnetic pull of the victim's alluring sister, her drawing power seemingly magnified exponentially by Leo's subconscious fears of impending fatherhood.\n\nAfter the far more playful foray into action comedy with his sophomore feature Dirty Mind, Belgian director Pieter Van Hees concludes the thematic trilogy he began with acclaimed debut Left Bank on a dark and oppressive note. This is a noir that embraces the darkest elements of the genre - elegant and highly intelligent, yes, but grimy, impulsive and seemingly filtered through a nicotine haze as well. Though Van Hees may not have won the international acclaim of his contemporaries such as Michael Roskam (Bullhead) he is every bit their equal and another example of the complex and compelling talent currently on the rise in Belgium.(Todd Brown)",
