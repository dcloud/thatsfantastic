    "raw_body": "Brief Summary\n\n\tIn order to atone for his past sins, he\u2019ll not only kick your ass, he\u2019ll impale your face and shred you to bits. Marko Zaror is the Redeemer!\n\nFull Description\n\n\tMarko Zaror is Pardo, a man with a heavy burden on his soul, looking for a way to atone for his past sins. As a vigilante, he stops criminals in their tracks and gives them only one chance to ask for forgiveness. Bad guys being bad guys, they rarely listen, and so Pardo disposes of them in any gruesome way available to him at the moment. He\u2019s just as likely to impale a man\u2019s face with a giant hook as he is to beat someone bloody with good old-fashioned punches and flip-kicks. When he crosses paths with Bradock (Noah Segan), Pardo suddenly has an entire criminal organization to contend with and finds himself caring for a woman for the first time since the tragedy that sent him on his current course.\n\n\tErnesto D\u00edaz Espinoza (KILTRO; MANDRILL) and Marko Zaror team up again to bring a violent, action-packed exploitation film from Chile to Austin. REDEEMER brings us a killing machine trapped in a broken man\u2019s body, a character that gives Zaror plenty of opportunity to show off his impressive abilities and range. Espinoza is now an expert at dropping Zaror into situations that pay off in giddiness-inducing showers of blood, and as such, REDEEMER boasts an impressive body count. Toss in a healthy dose of humor courtesy of Noah Segan as the villainous man-who-just-wants-his-dirty-money-back, and you\u2019ve got a kickass bit of fun custom made for Fantastic Fest.
