    "description": "Fantastic Fest alumna Mattie Do continues to cement her name as one of the most unique voices working within genre — or any other — cinema by delivering a science fiction and fable hybrid that continuously challenges the audience with unexpected twists and turns. It's a deeply visually arresting film about the cyclical nature of life.\n\nAn old Laotian hermit lives with the painful memories of his childhood; the death of his mother is the wellspring of his lifelong sadness. Discovering that the ghost of an accident victim can transport him into his own past propels him to correct the mistakes of yesterday in order to make amends for his life. But each choice comes with consequences, and the old man will discover that sometimes mistakes are there to teach us — and changing them can alter the world in ways he could never have imagined.\n\nAtmospheric, smart, and beautifully constructed, THE LONG WALK explores the width and breadth of the results of human action without ever resorting to cheap lectures. Do finds a midpoint between Eastern spiritualism and Western philosophy through which to examine the idea of karma and consequences, and does so in the most accessible way possible. Add to the mix the unexplored background of Laos, where science fiction and rural tradition mingle to create an otherworldly setup, and what you have is a film unlike any other. (EVRIM ERSOY)\n\nWith Director Mattie Do in Attendance.",
