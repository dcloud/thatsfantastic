    "description": "Colin (Romain Duris) appears to have everything. He's young, clever and healthy. He has great friends, an incredibly peculiar home and a musical instrument that mixes drinks based on the music played on it. What more could he need? Well, love, for one thing, which ultimately leads Colin to Chloe (AMELIE's Audrey Tatou). Before you know it, the pair are not only in love, but married, and life appears to be perfect... until Chloe falls ill with a mysterious flower growing in her lung.\n\nLong regarded as one of the greatest visual talents in the world, Gondry returns to the big screen with his adaptation of Boris Vian's cult novel of the same name. And though Gondry may not have been responsible for the original story, he has made it entirely and thoroughly his own, resulting in an explosion of colorful, astounding, playful visuals. Vian may have written the novel but MOOD INDIGO is the most Gondry film Gondry has ever done, the director matched perfectly to the material and seemingly given endless resources and complete freedom to do whatever he saw fit.\n\nBoasting an all star cast -- Duris and Tatou are joined by Omar Sy as Colin's lawyer and personal chef -- dropped into a fantasy world, MOOD INDIGO is a gorgeously realized fairy tale tinged with the surreal. Gondry breaks out every trick in his book, employing his trademark handmade effects, stop motion, whimsical sets and a total disregard for physics to create an utterly unique experience. You've never encountered anything quite like Mood Indigo. (Todd Brown)",
