    "description": "From director Malgorzata Szumowska, whose previous work has included the brilliant and challenging MUG and BODY, comes a searing examination of the patriarchy as filtered through the microcosm of a cult.\n\nSelah follows the Shepherd, a mysterious man who founded the cult she belongs to. All members of the cult are women, labelled either sisters or mothers by Shepherd, and live a life strictly governed by his rules. However, as Selah takes her first steps into young adulthood, her growing bond with the outcast Sarah sows the seeds of doubt, starting Selah on a journey of destruction that will engulf not only her but also the only world she has ever known.\n\nBlessed with an electric atmosphere and quiet but impactful performances, THE OTHER LAMB mercilessly examines the power politics of societies ruled with didactic tenets, as well as the oppressive nature of patriarchy. With Shepherd, Szumowska crafts an enigmatic figure that is dictator, seducer, and father all rolled into one, a complex other who incites the fires of oppression within his followers by whatever means necessary.\n\nDesigned to shock, to provoke, and to instigate, THE OTHER LAMB is ferocious filmmaking at its best: brute force delivered through a whisper with exquisite imagery. (EVRIM ERSOY)\n\nWith Screenwriter Catherine McMullen booked for 1st half.",
