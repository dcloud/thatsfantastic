    "description": "Please do not ask Sergeant Salmander about Gunnar. He loved that horse dearly and nobody feels worse about what happened to Salmander's noble steed than Salmander himself. Yes, he understands that there were children present at the Independence Day parade who may require significant, long term counseling to come to terms with what they witnessed that fateful day but still, he feels bad, okay?<p>Sergeant Salmander's journey may begin with a horse in Oslo, but it ends with a posting in HELLFJORD – a tiny town in the ass end of Norway where Salmander will serve as the district sheriff for the three month notification period  labor law requires before he is summarily fired from the police force. Can he save his job by doing an exceptionally good job during his months in the far north? Probably not, but he intends to give it all he's got.",
