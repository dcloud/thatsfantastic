    "description": "Perhaps Takashi Miike's most compact and contained film of recent years, FIRST LOVE sees the master at his absolute best: zany, madcap, violent, and utterly hilarious.\n\nLeo, a brilliant and aspiring boxer focused entirely on winning, gets the news that he might be fatally sick, knocking him off course and into the path of Monica, a drug-addicted call girl involved with a Yakuza underling and his girlfriend. The scene is quickly overrun with armies of Chinese mafia, the Yakuza, assassins, corrupt cops, and a whole load of meth...all in the course of one fateful night. With that inimitable and masterful Miike style, it will all end in bloodshed.\n\nFull of incredible characters, endless style, and arresting visuals, FIRST LOVE slams the audience at breakneck speed from post to post, taking them on a wild ride. Miike's direction, assured and deliberate, is aided by the incredible performances of the game cast; especially Becky who plays Julie, a force of nature who will win the heart of every audience member.\n\nRecalling early Miike efforts with an energy only the master can muster, FIRST LOVE is an unmissable treat: a violent and funny foray into the world of nighttime Tokyo, a twilight land of encounters weird and wonderful. (EVRIM ERSOY)\n\nWith Director Takashi Miike and Producer Misako Saka in Attendance for 1st half.",
