    "description": "Presented by the American Genre Film Archive.\n\nA carnival con man discovers that he has genuine psychic powers and uses them to become an astrology bigwig. But the plot isn't necessarily the focus of THE ASTROLOGER. It's the kind of film where the main character makes a movie that is basically THE ASTROLOGER within the movie and then we get to spend a few minutes watching The Astrologer watch THE ASTROLOGER inside the movie THE ASTROLOGER! It's the kind of movie that has an entire dynamic dinner scene shot entirely in slow-motion. It's the kind of movie where someone shouts, \"You're not an astrologer... YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE!\" And it's all done without an ounce of irony. It's all genuine, it's all passion, it's all GOOD. (Brian Kelley)\n\nNon-profit organization the American Genre Film Archive (AGFA) is the largest single collection of 35mm exploitation films in the world. Visit americangenrefilm.com for more info.",
