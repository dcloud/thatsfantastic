    "description": "A young three-piece rock band (played by Mariana Olivera, Gabriela Freire and Agustín Urrutia) set out to write a concept album about their lives. While filming music videos for the album, the trio stumbles across an abandoned gold mine. The mine is guarded by a \"local god\"—an ancient carved idol intended to frighten the mine workers. Once the idol is disturbed by the group, a horrible force is unleashed.\n\nIn 2012, Uruguayan director Gustavo Hernández burst onto the international horror scene with LA CASA MUDA, a feature-length horror film shot in a single take. That film was later remade in English as THE SILENT HOUSE. With his follow up LOCAL GOD, Hernandez delivers a powerful horror film with a singular aesthetic and a deep emotional resonance.",
