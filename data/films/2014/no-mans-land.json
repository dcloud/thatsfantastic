    "description": "When a cocksure lawyer heads into the badlands of China's Xinjiang province, hoping a pro bono case will win him fame and acclaim, he sets into motion a series of unfortunate events that expose the harsh realities of life in the next world superpower. Writer-director Ning Hao made a splash at Fantastic Fest V with his labyrinthine crime caper CRAZY RACER, but this unflinching, darkly comic follow-up exposes his homeland as an amoral wasteland populated by hookers, crooks and con artists looking to make a quick buck. It's little wonder the Chinese censors balked at Ning's too-honest portrayal and it went unreleased for four long years.",
