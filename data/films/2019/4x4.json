    "description": "In an affluent neighborhood in Argentina, brash car thief Ciro (Peter Lanzani) sees his latest target: a gleaming 4x4 sitting unguarded. A quick and efficient professional, he effortlessly enters the sleek new car, ready to take what he needs, clueless that his nightmare is about to take off. Within minutes Ciro realizes he's locked in the car, there's no way out, and this is going to be one trip he'll never forget.\n\nA neat, claustrophobic thriller that kicks off in fourth gear and only revs up higher, 4X4 is the kind of high-concept thriller we often dream about discovering. With a killer central performance from Lanzani as the rash thief, the film wastes no time in establishing its central concept and taking it as far as it can go. What could have been a slow burn tale of entrapment is instead a neck-breaking speed thriller where everything that can go wrong will go wrong. Our lead will try, try, and try again even though each audacious attempt will cost him a touch more of his body, of his mind, and of his soul.\n\nBlessed with one of the best sound designs of any film this year, 4X4 invites its audience to go on a wild ride exploring the recent sense of insecurity in Argentina, while never losing track of its one true goal: give the audience a thrill ride they'll remember long after the credits have rolled.
