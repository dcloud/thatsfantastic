    "description": "A pair of brothers are confronted by a policeman in their apartment. A violent struggle ensues. The fight continues into a stairwell. When they attempt to exit, they find that the staircase has turned into an infinitely repeating corridor from which they cannot escape. During the same time frame, a family leaves home for a vacation. They travel down a familiar road towards their destination. As time passes, the stretch of road and the surrounding desert begin to repeat. Like their counterparts in the stairwell, they are also stuck in a loop.\n\nIn 2013, Isaac Ezban pitched THE INCIDENT at the inaugural edition of Fantastic Market/Mercado Fantastico. The jury awarded the project with Best Presentation. The completed film premiered at the 2014 edition of March√© du Film as part of a special week of screenings organized by Blood Window at Ventana Sur. Now, Fantastic Fest is proud to present the film's North American premiere.\n\nTHE INCIDENT is a surrealistic sci-fi vision that uses the idea of infinite loops to explore both the frailty of human life and broader metaphysical concepts. Ezban's influences, which range from Philip K. Dick to Rod Serling, are readily apparent, but there is a very original vision at work here. Repetition is a key component of the film with the two stories taking place over a decades-long time span. The characters spend the rest of their lives trapped in loops. While elements of their environments constantly regenerate, none of them escape the reality of aging and death. THE INCIDENT is an ambitious, puzzle-like film from a rising new talent.
