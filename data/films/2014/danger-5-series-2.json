    "description": "Tucker. Claire. Jackson. Ilsa. Pierre. Their names have gone down in history as the brave heroes of Danger 5, the international team of super soldiers who would let nothing deter them in their mission to eliminate Adolf Hitler and his plans for global domination. Subterranean monkey people couldn't stop them. Giant robots couldn't stop them. Not even rocket launcher-wielding dinosaurs could stop them. For these were truly heroic heroes and their mission ended only with the end of Hitler.\n\nBut wait!... Could Hitler's death have been a ruse? A clever diversion? Is it possible that the Nazi leader escaped alive only to lurk in hiding, awaiting his chance to return? And what if that chance comes now? In the 1980s? In high school? Yes, it's time for Danger 5 to dust off their books and head back to class.\n\nFantastic Fest was proud to bring the first series of Dario Russo and David Ashby's award-winning Australian comedy to American audiences for the first time as part of our 2012 edition, and now we're thrilled to host the world premiere of the first three episodes of series two! Don't call it a parody, DANGER 5 is a glorious celebration, a loving mash-up of classic adventure tropes with B-grade science fiction and – in this new series – a dash of John Hughes. Because let's face it: That jerk who beat you up in high school? That was totally Adolf Hitler, right? (Todd Brown)",
