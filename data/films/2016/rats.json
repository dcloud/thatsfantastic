    "description": "\"I've spent 48 years trying to exterminate them. You don't know what we're up against. They're just too damn organized and too damn smart. I'm no scientist, but if humans went extinct, the rats would take over.\" â€“ Ed Sheehan, New York City exterminator\n\nThey live and eat where either we can't see them or we're afraid to look. But make no mistake; we're sharing this world with tons and tons of rats. In fact, there may be as many rats on this planet as there are people. They are more cunning than we know. They develop stronger biological defenses to poison than we can keep up with. They're among nature's greatest survivalists and they helped kill up to 200 million people in Eurasia during the Middle Ages. Morgan Spurlock's new doc shines as much light as possible on rats. Taking us all over the world, Spurlock shows us the people that try to control their population, the scientists who study them to track the diseases and parasites they carry. He takes us to the markets of Southeast Asia where the rat is a commodity, to England where hunting rats is sport, and to India where the rat is possibly your grandfather.\n\nSpurlock's doc is graphic and not for the easily offended. His eye is unflinching and the visuals are as pointed as a rat's teeth. But for those who dare, it's an unforgettable visual journey into the world of one of our most hated yet common neighbors. Because it won't be easily forgotten, it's a can't-miss event at this year's fest. (James Emanuel Shapiro)",
