Unfortunately for Nani, local real estate and construction magnate Sudeep is also smitten with Bindhu. Sudeep usually gets what he wants, and in this case he's not going to let Bindhu get away. The only way to make that happen is to get rid of Nani, but killing him doesn't quite get the job done. Reincarnated as a fly, Nani plots and executes his revenge with spectacular flair. Can a fly really take out a human? You will believe after witnessing the insanity of EEGA.",
