    "description": "Restoration Director Russell Cherrington LIVE in attendance!\n\nNIGHTBREED—the film version of Clive Barker's novel CABAL—was theatrically released in 1990. Although horror fans revere the film, its path to the big screen was acrimonious. NIGHTBREED was taken away from Barker and severely cut in an attempt to create a more commercially palatable film. In recent years, videotapes of the original cut resurfaced. Working in conjunction with Barker's Seraphim Films, Russell Cherrington and his crew supervised an entirely new edit of the film that integrates the recovered footage with the footage from the theatrical release. The result of these efforts is a new 144 version: NIGHTBREED: THE CABAL CUT.\n\nThe difference between THE CABAL CUT and the original version is like night and day. Plotlines are expanded, characters are further developed—particularly the role of Dr. Philip K. Decker (played by David Cronenberg)—and important scenes are restored. NIGHTBREED: THE CABAL CUT provides fans of the original with a rare opportunity to see the film as Clive Barker intended while introducing a new generation to a horror classic. (Rodney Perkins)",
