    "description": "Director Yudai Yamaguchi and Producer Masaru Yabe wil be LIVE in attendance!\n\n\nIn 1995, before they joined forces to help create the low-budget Japanese action classic Versus, writer / director Yudai Yamaguchi (Battlefield Baseball, Cromartie High School, Meatball Machine, Yakuza Weapon) and actor / action choreographer Tak Sakaguchi (Death Trance, Shinobi) teamed up to create a crazy, independent short film called Snot Rockets & Super Detective. Now, 17 years later, the pair have joined forces again to reboot a brand-new, feature-length version of the short, and it's even more lunatic and unpredictable than what came before.\n\n\nTak stars as Tebana Sankichiâ€”lover of women, rescuer of the fallen, sometime private detective, wayward son, homeless bum, celebrity, bullied child, spoiled rich kid, and fighting master. In what can politely be described as a \"loose episodic comedy,\" we follow Sankichi's increasingly bizarre adventures across space and time, and his long-suffering partnership with \"Twice\" Shiro, his bespectacled, put-upon partner, as well as the efforts of a hard-working postman trying to deliver a very important letter to him.\n\n\nShot across the globe in Tokyo, Yubari, Philadelphia, New York, and even in Austin during Fantastic Fest 2011, TEBANA SANKICHI: SNOT ROCKETS is now bigger, longer, and packs more power per inch than ever before. Careening recklessly from suicide humor to Tora-san references to traditional New Year's Day television greetings to horror homage and yakuza movie references, it's a film guaranteed to wear the audience out with its relentless pace, and make you cry \"mercy!\" A radical departure from anything the filmmakers have done in the past few years, and produced on a shoestring budget, TEBANA SANKICHI is a demonstration of how much Yudai and Tak continue to push the boundaries of the action/comedy film, and is their latest shot across the bow of good taste and good judgment. Watch it if you dare! (Marc Walkow)",
