    "description": "If revenge is known as cinema's most pure motivation, then surely redemption is its most complicated. Such is the case for FATAL's main character Sung-gong, forever haunted by his forced inclusion in a brutal gang rape ten years ago. Now leading a solitary life, Sung-gong fatefully runs into a Christian youth group who could possibly offer him the salvation he desperately needs. Things aren't that easy, as the road to forgiveness will force him to confront his past when he discovers the rape victim is a member of his new church.\n\nFATAL's literal Korean title translates to \"thorn flower,\" which might strike one as a more accurate title for this picture. Lee's film is full of contradictions, including being both beautiful and painful at the same time. You can even argue that either one of the two main characters is the flower of the title. It's also easy to compare this feature to several films in Korean auteur Kim Ki-Duk's filmography, filled with the rawness, complexity and devastation; so it shouldn't surprise you to learn that KKD had a hand in getting his longtime production partner Finecut to finance FATAL. But, ultimately Lee Dong-ku and FATAL stand on their own, signaling another great talent out of Korea. FATAL is one of the great discoveries of this year's fest. (James Shapiro)",
